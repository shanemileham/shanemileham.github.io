<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<h3 id="1-innocent-moves">1. Innocent Moves</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Bruce slowed me down by asking questions. Whenever I made an important decision, good or bad, he would ask me to explain my thought process. Were there other ways to accomplish the same aim? Had I looked for my opponent’s threats? Did I consider a different order of operations? Bruce didn’t patronize me— some teachers rebel so far away from being authoritarian that they praise all their little player’s decisions, good or bad. Their intention is to build confidence, but instead they discourage objectivity, encourage self-indulgence, and perhaps most destructively, they create a dishonest relationship between instructor and pupil that any bright child can sense.”</li>
  <li>“Bruce and I also spent a lot of time studying endgames, where the board is nearly empty and high-level principles combine with deep calculations to create fascinating battles. While my opponents wanted to win in the openings, right off the bat, I guided positions into complicated middlegames and abstract endings. So as the game went on, their confidence shrank and I became a predator.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-losing-to-win">2. Losing to Win</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Our lessons now included raucous speed chess sessions with breaks to toss a football outside. We began to laugh and connect as human beings as we had in our first sessions years before.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-two-approaches-to-learning">3. Two Approaches to Learning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“<em>entity</em> and <em>incremental</em> theories of intelligence.”</li>
  <li>“Children who are “entity theorists”— that is, kids who have been influenced by their parents and teachers to think in this manner— are prone to use language like “I am smart at this” and to attribute their success or failure to an ingrained and unalterable level of ability. They see their overall intelligence or skill level at a certain discipline to be a fixed entity, a thing that cannot evolve.”</li>
  <li>“Incremental theorists, who have picked up a different modality of learning— let’s call them learning theorists— are more prone to describe their results with sentences like “I got it because I worked very hard at it” or “I should have tried harder.” A child with a learning theory of intelligence tends to sense that with hard work, difficult material can be grasped— step by step, incrementally, the novice can become the master.”</li>
  <li>“learning theorists are far more likely to rise to the level of the game, while entity theorists are more brittle and prone to quit.”</li>
  <li>“In my experience, successful people shoot for the stars, put their hearts on the line in every battle, and ultimately discover that the lessons learned from the pursuit of excellence mean much more than the immediate trophies and glory. In the long run, painful losses may prove much more valuable than wins— those who are armed with a healthy attitude and are able to draw wisdom from every experience, “good” or “bad,” are the ones who make it down the road. They are also the ones who are happier along the way.”</li>
  <li>“I learned from the foundation up. Most of my rivals, on the other hand, began by studying opening variations.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-loving-the-game">4. Loving the Game</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“One of the most critical strengths of a superior competitor in any discipline— whether we are speaking about sports, business negotiations, or even presidential debates— is the ability to dictate the tone of the battle.”</li>
  <li>“It would be easy to read about the studies on entity vs. incremental theories of intelligence and come to the conclusion that a child should never win or lose. I don’t believe this is the case. If that child discovers any ambition to pursue excellence in a given field later in life, he or she may lack the toughness to handle inevitable obstacles.”</li>
  <li>“There will be nothing learned from any challenge in which we don’t try our hardest.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-the-soft-zone">5. The Soft Zone</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“In performance training, first we learn to flow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-sufficient and create our own earthquakes, so our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.”</li>
  <li>“The nature of your state of concentration will determine the first phase of your reaction—if you are tense, with your fingers jammed in your ears and your whole body straining to fight off distraction, then you are in a Hard Zone that demands a cooperative world for you to function. Like a dry twig, you are brittle, ready to snap under pressure. The alternative is for you to be quietly, intensely focused, apparently relaxed with a serene look on your face, but inside all the mental juices are churning. You flow with whatever comes, integrating every ripple of life into your creative moment.”</li>
  <li>“He has two options—one is to pave his road, to tame all of nature into compliance. The other is to make sandals.”</li>
  <li>“I couldn’t count on the world being silent, so my only option was to become at peace with the noise”</li>
  <li>“The victims of my training method were my parents and sister. A few times a week, while studying chess in my bedroom, I blasted music. Sometimes it was music I liked, sometimes music I didn’t like.”</li>
  <li>“Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. When injured, which happens frequently in the life of a martial artist, I try to avoid painkillers and to change the sensation of pain into a feeling that is not necessarily negative. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-the-downward-spiral">6. The Downward Spiral</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“One idea I taught was the importance of regaining presence and clarity of mind after making a serious error. This is a hard lesson for all competitors and performers. The first mistake rarely proves disastrous, but the downward spiral of the second, third, and fourth error creates a devastating chain reaction.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7-changing-voice">7. Changing Voice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“When I looked at the critical position from my tournament game, what had stumped me a few days or hours or weeks before now seemed perfectly apparent. I saw the best move, felt the correct plan, understood the evaluation of the position. I couldn’t explain this new knowledge with variations or words. It felt more elemental, like rippling water or a light breeze. My chess intuition had deepened. This was the study of numbers to leave numbers.”</li>
  <li>“During my study of the critical positions, I noted the feeling I had during the actual chess game.”</li>
  <li>“Once I recognized that deeply buried secrets in a competitor tend to surface under intense pressure, my study of chess became a form of psychoanalysis.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="8-breaking-stallions">8. Breaking Stallions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“A key component of high-level learning is cultivating a resilient awareness that is the older, conscious embodiment of a child’s playful obliviousness.”</li>
  <li>“I believe that one of the most critical factors in the transition to becoming a conscious high performer is the degree to which your relationship to your pursuit stays in harmony with your unique disposition.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="9-beginners-mind">9. Beginner’s Mind</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“It is Chen’s opinion that a large obstacle to a calm, healthy, present existence is the constant interruption of our natural breathing patterns.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="10-investment-in-loss">10. Investment in Loss</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“I have long believed that if a student of virtually any discipline could avoid ever repeating the same mistake twice—both technical and psychological—he or she would skyrocket to the top of their field.”</li>
  <li>“While I was internalizing this information, I was also constantly training with people who were far more advanced. They absolutely manhandled me.”</li>
  <li>“Great ones are willing to get burned time and again as they sharpen their swords in the fire.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="11-making-smaller-circles">11. Making Smaller Circles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Practicing in this manner, I was able to sharpen my feeling for Tai Chi. When through painstaking refinement of a small movement I had the improved feeling, I could translate it onto other parts of the form, and suddenly everything would start flowing at a higher level.”</li>
  <li>“incrementally condense the external manifestation of the technique while keeping true to its essence. Over time expansiveness decreases while potency increases. I call this method “Making Smaller Circles.””</li>
  <li>“Depth beats breadth any day of the week, because it opens a channel for the intangible, unconscious, creative components of our hidden potential.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="12-using-adversity">12. Using Adversity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“In the chapter The Soft Zone, I mentioned that there are three critical steps in a resilient performer’s evolving relationship to chaotic situations. First, we have to learn to be at peace with imperfection. I mentioned the image of a blade of grass bending to hurricane-force winds in contrast to a brittle twig snapping under pressure. Next, in our performance training, we learn to use that imperfection to our advantage— for example thinking to the beat of the music or using a shaking world as a catalyst for insight. The third step of this process, as it pertains to performance psychology, is to learn to create ripples in our consciousness, little jolts to spur us along, so we are constantly inspired whether or not external conditions are inspiring.”</li>
  <li>“The importance of undulating between external and internal (or concrete and abstract; technical and intuitive) training applies to all disciplines, and unfortunately the internal tends to be neglected.”</li>
  <li>“I realized that whenever I could control two of his limbs with one of mine, I could easily use my unoccupied arm for free-pickings.”</li>
  <li>“On the chessboard it is also relevant. Any moment that one piece can control, inhibit, or tie down two or more pieces, a potentially critical imbalance is created on the rest of the board.”</li>
  <li>“I did a daily resistance workout routine on my left side, and after every set I visualized the workout passing to the muscles on the right. My arm was in a cast, so there was no actual motion possible—but I could feel the energy flowing into the unused muscles. I admit it was a shot in the dark, but it worked.”</li>
  <li>“One thing I have learned as a competitor is that there are clear distinctions between what it takes to be decent, what it takes to be good, what it takes to be great, and what it takes to be among the best. If your goal is to be mediocre, then you have a considerable margin for error.”</li>
  <li>“If I want to be the best, I have to take risks others would avoid, always optimizing the learning potential of the moment and turning adversity to my advantage.”</li>
  <li>“When aiming for the top, your path requires an engaged, searching mind. You have to make obstacles spur you to creative new angles in the learning process. Let setbacks deepen your resolve. You should always come off an injury or a loss better than when you went down.”</li>
  <li>“Ultimately we should learn how to use the lessons from this type of experience without needing to get injured”</li>
  <li>“Once we learn how to use adversity to our advantage, we can manufacture the helpful growth opportunity without actual danger or injury. I call this tool the internal solution— we can notice external events that trigger helpful growth or performance opportunities, and then internalize the effects of those events without their actually happening.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="13-slowing-down-time">13. Slowing Down Time</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Clearly, there is a survival mechanism that allows human beings to channel their physical and mental capacities to an astonishing degree of intensity in life-or-death moments. But can we do this at will?”</li>
  <li>“start with the fundamentals, get a solid foundation fueled by understanding the principles of your discipline, then you expand and refine your repertoire, guided by your individual predispositions, while keeping in touch, however abstractly, with what you feel to be the essential core of the art. What results is a network of deeply internalized, interconnected knowledge that expands from a central, personal locus point.”</li>
  <li>“Chunking relates to the mind’s ability to assimilate large amounts of information into a cluster that is bound together by certain patterns or principles particular to a given discipline.”</li>
  <li>“So, in a nutshell, chunking relates to the mind’s ability to take lots of information, find a harmonizing/logically consistent strain, and put it together into one mental file that can be accessed as if it were a single piece of information.”</li>
  <li>“The idea is to shift the primary role from the conscious to the unconscious without blissing out and losing the precision the conscious can provide.”</li>
  <li>“The Grandmaster consciously looks at less, not more.”</li>
  <li>“The key to this process is understanding that the conscious mind, for all its magnificence, can only take in and work with a certain limited amount of information in a unit of time”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="14-the-illusion-of-the-mystical">14. The Illusion of the Mystical</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“My experimentation with intentionality began during my early chess years. I’m a bit embarrassed to admit that as a seven-year-old boy in scholastic chess tournaments, I sometimes lured my young opponents into blundering by 1) making a move that set a trap and then 2) immediately groaning and slapping my head.”</li>
  <li>“By the time I was ten or eleven years old, a slap on the head would have been an absurdly transparent display of trickery. But a little change in my breathing pattern might alert a rival that I had just seen something I didn’t like.”</li>
  <li>“By the time I moved into the competitive martial arts, I was very much in tune with my tells, and was quite good at manipulating opponents’ impressions of my state of mind. I had also reached a fairly high level of reading psychological wrinkles. It was during these years that I began to cultivate methods of systematically controlling my opponents’ intention.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="15-the-power-of-presence">15. The Power of Presence</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Maintain the tension—becoming at peace with mounting pressure.”</li>
  <li>“In every discipline, the ability to be clearheaded, present, cool under fire is much of what separates the best from the mediocre.”</li>
  <li>“The secret is that everything is always on the line. The more present we are at practice, the more present we will be in competition, in the boardroom, at the exam, the operating table, the big stage.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="16-searching-for-the-zone">16. Searching for the Zone</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Cardiovascular interval training can have a profound effect on your ability to quickly release tension and recover from mental exhaustion.”</li>
  <li>“Interval work is a critical building block to becoming a consistent long-term performer.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="17-building-your-trigger">17. Building Your Trigger</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“After he had fully internalized his routine, I suggested that he do it the morning before going to an important meeting. So Dennis transplanted his routine from a prelude to playing catch with his son to a prelude to work. He did so and came back raving”</li>
  <li>“The point to this system of creating your own trigger is that a physiological connection is formed between the routine and the activity it precedes.”</li>
  <li>“What good is a thirty- or forty-five-minute routine if you only have minutes or seconds of warning before the big event?”</li>
  <li>“This is where my system for condensing the routine comes in.”</li>
  <li>“Incrementally, I started shortening the amount of form I did before starting my training. I did a little less than the whole form, then 3/4 of it, 1/2, 1/4”</li>
  <li>“I trained myself to be completely prepared after a deep inhalation and release. I also learned to do the form in my mind without moving at all.”</li>
  <li>“Once a simple inhalation can trigger a state of tremendous alertness, our moment-to-moment awareness becomes blissful,”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="18-making-sandals">18. Making Sandals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“To walk a thorny road, we may cover its every inch with leather or we can make sandals.”</li>
  <li>“Then there are those elite performers who use emotion, observing their moment and then channeling everything into a deeper focus that generates a uniquely flavored creativity.”</li>
  <li>“First, we learn to flow with distraction, like that blade of grass bending to the wind. Then we learn to use distraction, inspiring ourselves with what initially would have thrown us off our games. Finally we learn to re-create the inspiring settings internally. We learn to make sandals.”</li>
  <li>“It is easy to speak of nonviolence when I am in a flower garden. The real internal challenge is to maintain that fundamental perspective when confronted by hostility, aggression, and pain.”</li>
  <li>“Now that changed. I had an issue to work on and Frank would be the ideal training partner. The first step I had to make was to recognize that the problem was mine, not Frank’s. There will always be creeps in the world, and I had to learn how to deal with them with a cool head. Getting pissed off would get me nowhere in life.”</li>
  <li>“If someone got into my head, they were doing me a favor, exposing a weakness. They were giving me a valuable opportunity to expand my threshold for turbulence. Dirty players were my best teachers.”</li>
  <li>“Guys like Miller, Jordan, Hernandez, and Robinson are so far beyond shakable that opponents, instead of playing mental games, cower for fear of inspiring them.”</li>
  <li>“He believed that if his mood and the chess position were in synch, he would be most inclined to play with the greatest inspiration.”</li>
  <li>“Step by step, Garry would feed off his own chess moves, off the created position, and off his opponents’ building fear, until soon enough the confidence would become real and Garry would be in flow.”</li>
  <li>“But how do you play your best when there is no one around to provide motivation? There is no cookie-cutter mold to inspiration. There is, however, a process we can follow to discover our unique path. First, we cultivate The Soft Zone, we sit with our emotions, observe them, work with them, learn how to let them float away if they are rocking our boat, and how to use them when they are fueling our creativity. Then we turn our weaknesses into strengths until there is no denial of our natural eruptions and nerves sharpen our game, fear alerts us, anger funnels into focus. Next we discover what emotional states trigger our greatest performances. This is truly a personal question. Some of us will be most creative when ebullient, others when morose. To each his own. Introspect. Then Make Sandals, become your own earthquake, Spike Lee, or tailing fastball. Discover what states work best for you and, like Kasparov, build condensed triggers so you can pull from your deepest reservoirs of creative inspiration at will.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="19-bringing-it-all-together">19. Bringing it All Together</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“We are unique individuals who should put our own flair into everything we do.”</li>
  <li>“The real art in learning takes place as we move beyond proficiency, when our work becomes an expression of our essence.”</li>
  <li>“This next phase of my learning process would be about building and refining a competitive repertoire that was uniquely my own.”</li>
  <li>“In Making Smaller Circles we take a single technique or idea and practice it until we feel its essence. Then we gradually condense the movements while maintaining their power, until we are left with an extremely potent and nearly invisible arsenal. In Slowing Down Time, we again focus on a select group of techniques and internalize them until the mind perceives them in tremendous detail. After training in this manner, we can see more frames in an equal amount of time, so things feel slowed down. In The Illusion of the Mystical, we use our cultivation of the last two principles to control the intention of the opponent—and again, we do this by zooming in on very small details to which others are completely oblivious.”</li>
  <li>“Almost without exception, champions are specialists whose styles emerge from profound awareness of their unique strengths, and who are exceedingly skilled at guiding the battle in that direction.”</li>
  <li>“I came upon my fundamental strategy for the tournament—what chess players call prophylaxis.”</li>
  <li>“I developed a game that was based on squelching his talents. In Taiwan I would play in the style of Karpov or Petrosian, the Grandmasters who triggered my existential crisis at the end of my chess career.”</li>
  <li>“We would then convert what had been creative inspiration into something we understood technically.”</li>
  <li>“The technical afterthoughts of a truly great one can appear to be divine inspiration to the lesser artist.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="20-taiwan-and-afterword">20. Taiwan (and Afterword)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“In the end, mastery involves discovering the most resonant information and integrating it so deeply and fully it disappears and allows us to fly free.”</li>
</ul>
