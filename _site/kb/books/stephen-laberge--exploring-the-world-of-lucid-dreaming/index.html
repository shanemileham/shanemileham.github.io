<h3 id="1-the-world-of-lucid-dreaming">1. The World of Lucid Dreaming</h3>
<h4 id="life-is-short">Life is Short</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Is sleeping through your dreams the best use of your limited lifespan? Not only are you wasting part of your finite store of time to be alive, but you are missing adventures and lessons that could enrich the rest of your life.”</li>
  <li>““Dreams are a reservoir of knowledge and experience,” writes Tibetan Buddhist Tarthang Tulku, “yet they are often overlooked as a vehicle for exploring reality””</li>
  <li>“We can carry not only knowledge but also moods from the lucid dream state to the waking state.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-experience-of-lucid-dreaming">The Experience of Lucid Dreaming</h4>
<ul>
  <li><em>Exercise: Your Present State of Consciousness</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lucid-dreaming-and-waking-life">Lucid Dreaming and Waking Life</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Because the objects of waking perception actually exist independently of your mind, they remain relatively stable. For example, you can look at this sentence, shut the book for a moment, and reopen to the same page, and you will see the same sentence. But, as you will see in Chapter 3, the same is not true for dreaming.”</li>
  <li>““Impossible” things could happen, and the dream scene itself, rather than disappearing once you know it to be “unreal,” might increase in clarity and brilliance until you found yourself dumbfounded with wonder.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-preparation-for-learning-lucid-dreaming">2. Preparation for Learning Lucid Dreaming</h3>
<h4 id="learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Many people experience lucid dreams after reading or hearing about lucid dreaming for the first time. This may be akin to beginner’s luck”</li>
  <li>“Your lucid dream training will start with keeping a dream journal and improving your dream recall. Your preparation for Learning Lucid Dreaming journal will help you discover what your dreams are like. The next step will be to use your collection of dreams to find peculiarities (dreamsigns) that appear often enough in your dreams to be reliable signposts of the dream state. Your list of dreamsigns will help you succeed with the lucid dream induction techniques presented in Chapters 3 and 4.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sleeping-brain-dreaming-mind">Sleeping Brain, Dreaming Mind</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Your brain accomplishes its world-modeling task so well that you ordinarily aren’t aware that it is modeling anything. You look with your eyes, and you see. The experience of visual perception seems as straightforward as looking out a window and simply seeing what is there. Nonetheless, seeing, hearing, feeling, or perceiving through any other sense is a process of mental modeling, a simulation of reality. The contents of your consciousness, that is, your current experiences, are constructed and depend on your present purposes, what you are doing and what relevant information is currently available.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-mind-in-sleep">The mind in sleep</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“While awake and active, the model accurately reflects your relationship to the external world.”</li>
  <li>“In the case of sleep, so little sensory input is available from the outside world that you stop maintaining a conscious model of it. When your sleeping brain is activated enough to construct a world model in your consciousness, the model is mostly independent from what is happening in your environment – in other words, a dream.”</li>
  <li>“During the active sleep phase, commonly called rapid eye movement or REM sleep, your eyes move rapidly about (under closed lids, of course), much as they would if you were awake. Your breathing becomes quick and irregular, your brain burns as much fuel as it does when you’re awake, and you dream vividly.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-sleepers-night-journey">The sleeper’s night journey</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Approximately seventy to ninety minutes after sleep onset, you enter REM sleep for the first time of the night. After five or ten minutes of REM, and possibly following a brief awakening in which you would likely remember a dream, you sink back into Stage 2 and possibly delta, coming up again for another REM period approximately every ninety minutes, and so on through the night.”</li>
  <li>“While learning and practicing lucid dreaming, you should keep in mind two elaborations on this cycle: (1) the length of the REM periods increase as the night proceeds and (2) the intervals between REM periods decrease with time of night, from ninety minutes at the beginning of the night to perhaps only twenty to thirty minutes eight hours later.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="communiqué-from-the-dream-world">Communiqué from the dream world</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“I could look in any direction I wished while in a lucid dream, so it occurred to me that I ought to be able to signal while I was having a lucid dream by moving my eyes in a pre-arranged, recognizable pattern.”</li>
  <li>“During the night I had a lucid dream in which I moved my eyes left-right-left- right. The next morning, when we looked through the polygraph record, we found the eye movement signals in the middle of a REM period. At this writing, dozens of other lucid dreamers have also successfully signaled from lucid dreams, and these dreams have occurred almost exclusively during REM sleep.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-dreams-seem-real">Why dreams seem real</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“In all cases, we found time estimates made in lucid dreams were within a few seconds of estimates made in the waking state and likewise quite close to the actual time between signals. From this we have concluded that in lucid dreams, estimated dream time is very nearly equal to clock time; that is, it takes just as long to do something in a dream as it does to actually do it.”</li>
  <li>“The method of having lucid dreamers signal from the dream world by means of eye movements has demonstrated a strong relationship between the gazes of dreamers in the dream and their actual eye movements under closed lids.”</li>
  <li>“One of the most dramatic demonstrations of the correspondence between physiology and dream activity came from studies of lucid dream sex…. her vaginal muscle activity, vaginal pulse amplitude, and respiration rate reached their highest values of the night, and they also were considerably elevated in comparison to the rest of the REM period. Contrary to expectation, heart rate increased only slightly. Since then, we have carried out similar experiments with two male lucid dreamers. In both cases, respiration showed striking increases in rate. Again, there were no significant elevations of the heart rate. Interestingly, although both oneironauts reported vividly realistic orgasms in their lucid dreams, neither actually ejaculated, in contrast to the “wet dreams” commonly experienced by adolescent males, which frequently are not associated with erotic dreams.”</li>
  <li>“The experiments just reviewed supported the conclusion that the events you experience while asleep and dreaming produce effects on your brain (and, to a lesser extent, your body) much the same as if you were to experience the corresponding events while awake. Additional studies uphold this conclusion. When lucid dreamers hold their breaths or breathe fast in a dream, they really do hold their breaths or pant. Furthermore, the differences in brain activity caused by singing versus counting in the waking state (singing tends to engage the right hemisphere and counting, the left) are nearly duplicated in the lucid dream. In short, to our brains, dreaming of doing something is equivalent to actually doing it.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="social-values-and-lucid-dreaming">Social Values and Lucid Dreaming</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Our culture offers little social support to those interested in exploring mental states. This resistance probably has its roots in the behaviorist perspective in psychology, which treated all animals, including humans, as “black boxes” whose actions were entirely dependent on external inputs.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="concerns-about-lucid-dreaming-questions-and-answers">Concerns About Lucid Dreaming: Questions and Answers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“The overwhelming majority of lucid dreams are positive, rewarding experiences, much more so than ordinary dreams (to say nothing of nightmares). Nevertheless, there probably will be some people who find the experience of lucid dreaming frightening and, in some cases, extremely disturbing. For this reason we cannot recommend lucid dreaming to everyone. On the other hand, we are confident that for people no more than “normally neurotic,” lucid dreaming is completely harmless.”</li>
  <li>“Lucid dreams occur only rarely unless you go to sleep with the deliberate and definite intention to become conscious, or lucid, in your dreams. Thus, I understood that I would be able to regulate (and limit, if necessary) the frequency of my lucid dreams.”</li>
  <li>“dreams are not letters from the unconscious mind, but experiences created through the interactions of the unconscious and conscious mind. In dreams, more unconscious knowledge is available to our conscious experience.”</li>
  <li>“I don’t think that you should always be conscious that you are dreaming any more than I think that you should always be conscious of what you are doing in waking life. Sometimes self-consciousness can interfere with effective performance”</li>
  <li>“Dreaming lucidly is usually just as restful as dreaming nonlucidly. Since lucid dreams tend to be positive experiences, you may actually feel invigorated after them.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="getting-to-know-your-dreams">Getting to Know Your Dreams</h4>
<h5 id="how-to-recall-your-dreams">How to recall your dreams</h5>
<ul>
  <li>“Learning to remember your dreams is necessary if you want to learn how to dream lucidly.”</li>
  <li>“First, without recall, even if you do have a lucid dream, you won’t remember it.”</li>
  <li>“Second, good dream recall is crucial because to become lucid you have to recognize that your dream is a dream, while it is happening. Since they are your dreams that you are trying to recognize, you have to become familiar with what they are like.”</li>
  <li>“you need to get to know what your dreams are like, and in particular, what is dreamlike about them. You can accomplish this by collecting your dreams and analyzing them for dreamlike elements.”</li>
  <li>“Before it will be worth your time to work on lucid dream induction methods, you should be able to recall at least one dream every night.”</li>
  <li>“The first step to good dream recall is getting plenty of sleep.”</li>
  <li>“The first dream of the night is the shortest, perhaps only ten minutes in length, while after eight hours of sleep, dream periods can be forty-five minutes to an hour long.”</li>
  <li>“dreams are not recalled unless the sleeper awakens directly from the dream, rather than after going on to other stages of sleep.”</li>
  <li>“If you find that you sleep too deeply to awaken from your dreams, try setting an alarm clock to awaken you at a time when you are likely to be dreaming. Since REM periods occur at approximately ninety-minute intervals, good times will be multiples of ninety minutes from your bedtime. Aim for the later REM periods by setting the alarm to go off at four and a half, six, or seven and a half hours after you go to sleep.”</li>
  <li>“You should get into the habit of asking yourself this question the moment you awaken: “What was I dreaming?” Do this first or you’ll forget some or all of your dream, due to interference from other thoughts. Don’t move from the position in which you awaken…. Also, don’t think of the day’s concerns…. If you remember nothing, keep trying for several minutes, without moving or thinking of anything else. Usually, pieces and fragments of the dream will come to you…. ask yourself: “What was I just thinking?” and “How was I just feeling?””</li>
  <li>“When you recall a scene, ask yourself what happened before that, and before that”</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="keeping-a-dream-journal">Keeping a dream journal</h5>
<ul>
  <li>“Get a notebook or diary for writing down your dreams. The notebook should be attractive to you and exclusively dedicated for the purpose of recording dreams.”</li>
  <li>“Your dream journal is a tool, and you are the only person who is going to read it. Describe the way images and characters look and sound and smell, and don’t forget to describe the way you felt in the dream – emotional reactions are important clues in the dream world. Record anything unusual, the kinds of things that would never occur in waking life”</li>
  <li>“Put the date at the top of the page. Record your dream under the date, carrying over for as many pages as required. Leave a blank page following each dream description for exercises you will do later.”</li>
  <li>“title your journal entry with a short, catchy title that captures the subject or mood of the dream. “The Guardian of the Spring” or “Riot in the Classroom” are examples of good descriptive titles.”</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="dreamsigns-doors-to-lucidity">Dreamsigns: Doors to Lucidity</h5>
<ul>
  <li>“People don’t become lucid more often in the presence of dreamsigns because of a normal tendency to rationalize and confabulate – they make up stories to explain what is going on, or they think, “There must be some explanation.””</li>
  <li>“Each of us has his or her own individual dreamsigns”</li>
  <li>“There are four primary categories [of dreamsigns]. The first one, inner awareness, refers to things that dreamers (egos) perceive as happening within themselves, such as thoughts and feelings. The other three categories (action, form, and context) classify elements of the dream environment. The action category includes the activities and motions of everything in the dream world – the dream ego, other characters, and objects. Form refers to the shapes of things, people, and places, which are often bizarre and frequently transform in dreams. The final category is context. Sometimes in dreams the combination of elements – people, places, actions, or things, is odd, although there is nothing inherently strange about any item by itself.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-dreamsign-inventory">The Dreamsign Inventory</h4>
<h5 id="inner-awareness">Inner Awareness</h5>
<ul>
  <li>“You have a peculiar thought, a strong emotion, feel an unusual sensation, or have altered perceptions. The thought can be one that is unusual, that could occur only in a dream, or that “magically” affects the dream world. The emotion can be inappropriate or oddly overwhelming. Sensations can include the feeling of paralysis, or of leaving your body, as well as unusual physical feelings and unexpectedly sudden or intense sexual arousal. Perceptions may be unusually clear or fuzzy, or you may be able to see or hear something you wouldn’t be able to in waking life.”</li>
  <li><strong>Thoughts</strong> (e.g. “I’m trying to figure out where the house and furnishings are from, and I realize this is an odd thing to be thinking about.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Emotions</strong> (e.g. “I am filled with extreme anxiety and remorse.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Sensations</strong> (e.g. “It feels like there’s a giant hand squeezing my head.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Perceptions</strong> (e.g. “I somehow can hear two men talking even though they are far away.”)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="action">Action</h5>
<ul>
  <li>“You, another dream character, or a dream thing (including inanimate objects and animals) do something unusual or impossible in waking life. The action must occur in the dream environment, that is, not be a thought or feeling in the dreamer’s mind. Malfunctioning devices are examples of object action dreamsigns.”</li>
  <li><strong>Ego action</strong> (e.g. “I’m riding home on a unicycle.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Character action</strong> (e.g. “The hairdresser refers to a blueprint to cut my hair.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Object action</strong> (e.g. “The car accelerates dangerously, and the brakes don’t work.”)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="form">Form</h5>
<ul>
  <li>“Your shape, the shape of a dream character, or that of a dream object is oddly formed, deformed, or transforms. Unusual clothing and hair count as anomalies of form. Also, the place you are in (the setting) in the dream may be different than it would be in waking life.”</li>
  <li><strong>Ego form</strong> (e.g. “I am Mozart.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Character form</strong> (e.g. “Her face changes as I look at her.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Setting form</strong> (e.g. “The drafting room was the wrong shape.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Object form</strong> (e.g. “I see a tiny purple kitten.”)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="context">Context</h5>
<ul>
  <li>“The place or situation in the dream is strange. You may be somewhere that you are unlikely to be in waking life, or involved in a strange social situation. Also, you or another dream character could be playing an unaccustomed role. Objects or characters may be out of place, or the dream could occur in the past or future.”</li>
  <li><strong>Ego role</strong> (e.g. “It was a James Bond type of dream, with me in the starring role.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Character role</strong> (e.g. “My friend is assigned to be my husband.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Character place</strong> (e.g. “My coworkers and former high school friends are together.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Object place</strong> (e.g. “My bed was in the street.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Setting place</strong> (e.g. “I’m in an amusement park.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Setting time</strong> (e.g. “I am in grade school.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Situation</strong> (e.g. “A commercial is being filmed at my house.”)</li>

<ul>
  <li>“the relative likelihood of lucid dreaming continuously increases with each successive REM period”</li>
  <li>“The conclusion is obvious: If you want to encourage the occurrence of lucid dreams, extend your sleep. If you are serious about lucid dreaming, and can find the extra time, you should arrange at least one morning a week in which you can stay in bed for several hours longer than usual.”</li>
  <li>“If you find that you just cannot afford to spend more time in bed, there is a simple secret to increasing your frequency of lucid dreaming that requires no more time than the usual number of hours you sleep. The secret is to rearrange your sleep time. If you normally sleep from midnight to 6: 00 a. m., then get up at 4: 00 a. m. and stay awake for two hours, doing whatever you need to do. Go back to bed and catch up on your remaining sleep from 6: 00 to 8: 00 a. m. During the two hours of delayed sleep you will have much more REM than you would have had sleeping at the usual time (4: 00 to 6: 00), and you will enjoy an increased likelihood of lucid dreaming, with no time lost to sleep.”</li>

<h4 id="critical-state-testing">Critical State Testing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Pause now to ask yourself the following question: “Am I dreaming or awake, right now?” Be serious. Really try to answer the question to the best of your ability and be ready to justify your answer.”</li>
  <li>“The challenge, then, is how to activate the critical faculty before bed so that it remains sufficiently primed to function properly when it is needed to explain some strange occurrence in a dream.”</li>

<h4 id="exercise-critical-state-testing-technique">Exercise: Critical State Testing Technique</h4>

<h4 id="tips-on-state-testing">Tips on State Testing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“As most people know from firsthand experience, dreamers don’t always reason clearly.”</li>
  <li>“Trying to fly is a more reliable test used by many lucid dreamers. The easiest way to do this is to hop into the air and attempt to prolong your time off the ground. If you stay airborne for even a split second longer than normal, you can be sure you’re dreaming.”</li>
  <li>“Use the same test each time you do a state check. In my experience, the best test is the following: find some writing and read it once (if you can), look away, then reread it, checking to see if it stays the same. Every time I have tried this in my own lucid dreams the writing has mutated in some way. The words may no longer make sense or the letters may turn into hieroglyphics.”</li>
  <li>“An equally effective state test, if you normally wear a digital watch, is to look at its face twice; in a dream, it will never behave correctly (that is, with the numbers changing in the expected manner) and usually won’t show anything that makes sense at all”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="intention-techniques">Intention Techniques</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“The idea of cultivating a state of mind while awake for the purpose of carrying it into the dream state as a means of inducing lucid dreams has been used by Tibetan Buddhists for more than a thousand years.”</li>

<h4 id="mnemonic-induction-of-lucid-dreams-mild">Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“But how do we remember future intentions (this is called prospective memory) without relying on external reminders? Motivation plays an important role. You are less likely to forget to do something that you really want to do. When you set yourself the goal to remember to do something, you have made the goal one of your current concerns and thereby have activated a goal-seeking brain system that will stay partially activated until you have achieved it. If the goal is very important to you, the system stays highly activated and you keep checking to see if it’s time to do it, until it is time.”</li>
  <li>“When facing the challenge of remembering to do something, we can increase the likelihood of success by (1) being strongly motivated to remember and (2) forming mental associations between what we want to remember to do and the future circumstances in which we intend to do it.”</li>
  <li>“So before attempting MILD, you need to prove to yourself that you can indeed remember to do things while awake. If you are like most people, you are used to relying on external reminders and therefore need practice in remembering intentions using only your own mental power.”</li>

  <li>“Thus, my awakenings from REM in the lab were more likely to lead to conscious returns to REM than awakenings at home when I was sleeping with neither heightened consciousness of my environment and self nor any particular intent not to move”</li>
  <li>“Paul Tholey notes that, while techniques for direct entry to the dream state require considerable practice in the beginning, they offer correspondingly great rewards.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="attention-on-hypnagogic-imagery">Attention on Hypnagogic Imagery</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“The most common strategy for inducing WILDs is to fall asleep while focusing on the hypnagogic imagery that accompanies sleep onset. Initially, you are likely to see relatively simple images, flashes of light, geometric patterns, and the like. Gradually more complicated forms appear: faces, people, and finally entire scenes.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="attention-on-visualization">Attention on Visualization</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Another approach to the induction of WILDs, much favored by the Tibetan tradition, involves deliberate visualization of a symbol while focusing on hypnagogic imagery”</li>
  <li>“Yogic psychophysiology holds that our bodies contain “subtle centers of awareness” called chakras. Seven in number, they are located throughout the body, from the base of the spine to the top of the head. One of these, the throat chakra, is said to regulate sleep and wakefulness”</li>

<ul>
  <li>“The third visualization technique comes from Tarthang Tulku, a Tibetan teacher living and working in the United States”</li>
  <li>“The flame, Tulku explains, represents awareness: the same awareness with which we experience both our waking life and dreams. It therefore represents the potential for a continuity of awareness between wakefulness and sleep, the preservation of consciousness through sleep onset that we are trying to achieve. In Buddhist iconography, the lotus represents the process of spiritual unfoldment.”</li>

<h4 id="attention-on-other-mental-tasks">Attention on Other Mental Tasks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“You can also use any cognitive process that requires minimal but conscious effort to focus your mind while falling asleep. Thus, in what is now a familiar story, your body falls asleep while the cognitive process carries your conscious mind along with it into sleep. The basic approach requires that you lie in bed relaxed, but vigilant, and perform a repetitive mental task. You focus your attention on the task while your perception of the environment diminishes and gradually vanishes altogether as you fall asleep.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exercise-count-yourself-to-sleep-technique">Exercise: Count Yourself to Sleep Technique</h4>

<h4 id="attention-on-body-of-self">Attention on Body of Self</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“If you focus on your body while falling asleep, you will sometimes notice a condition in which it seems to undergo extreme distortions, or begins to shake with mysterious vibrations, or becomes completely paralyzed. All of these unusual bodily states are related to the process of sleep onset and particularly REM sleep onset.”</li>
  <li>“independent neural systems cause muscular paralysis, blockade of sensory input, and cortical activation. When these three systems are working together, your brain will be in the state of REM sleep, and you will probably be dreaming.”</li>
  <li>“Sometimes the REM systems don’t turn on or off at the same time…. The fact is, sleep paralysis is harmless.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="two-bodies-or-one">Two Bodies or One?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“As Tholey points out, the ‘experience of a second body is an unnecessary assumption based on a naive epistemology.’”</li>
  <li>“In fact, a person experiences only one body, and this isn’t the physical body, but the body image – the brain’s representation of the physical body. The body image is what we experience anytime we feel embodied, whether in our physical, dream, or astral out-of- bodies.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exercise-the-one-body-technique">Exercise: The One Body Technique</h4>

<h4 id="one-body-or-none">One Body or None?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“Now, let’s take a radical look at the brain’s body model. If it isn’t representing the position, activity, or condition of the physical body, why should it need to maintain a model of the appearance, functionality, topology, or form of the physical body? As Tholey puts it, ‘The experiencing of one’s own body in a dream is merely a phenomenon transferred from the waking state and is essentially expendable.’”</li>

<h3 id="1-the-world-of-lucid-dreaming-1">1. The World of Lucid Dreaming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Why lucid dream?
    <ul>
      <li>Life is short. Get 1/3 of it back.</li>
      <li>Can learn and explore reality</li>
      <li>Can improve waking mood</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lucid dreaming and the material world are very similar (including clarity), but certain things differ, such as persistence of information (e.g. text, time) and impossible things (based on our laws of physics)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-preparation-for-learning-lucid-dreaming-1">2. Preparation for Learning Lucid Dreaming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some people have a lucid dream after hearing about it (beginner’s luck)</li>
  <li>Keep a dream journal, find dreamsigns</li>
  <li>What you experience is constructed based on available and relevant information</li>
  <li>While sleeping, very little sensory information is available, so the world model you experience diverges significantly from your awakened model</li>
  <li>During REM, eyes move rapidly, breathing becomes erratic, your brain burns same fuel as when awake, and you dream</li>
  <li>REM schedule:
    <ul>
      <li>Starts 70 to 90min in</li>
      <li>Repeats 90min later and interval decreases each time (down to 20-30min)</li>
      <li>Length starts at 10min and increases each period (up to 60min)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Time estimates in dreams are accurate; dreams go at same speed as awake life</li>
  <li>Eye direction in dreams and real life is same</li>
  <li>Lucid dream sex
    <ul>
      <li>Respiration rate, vaginal muscle activity, and vaginal pulse amplitude increased dramatically</li>
      <li>HR increased only slightly</li>
      <li>No ejaculations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The events you experience while dreaming produce effects in brain and body as if you were awake
    <ul>
      <li>LD hold breath –&gt; hold in real life</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“to our brains, dreaming of doing something is equivalent to actually doing it”</li>
  <li>Dream recall is necessary to learn lucid dreaming
    <ul>
      <li>Even if you do LD, you won’t remember it</li>
      <li>Helps you recognize dream trends, which are required for many techniques</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Remember 1 dream per night before starting LD induction methods</li>
  <li>“Dreams are not recalled unless the sleeper awakens directly from the dream” ?</li>
  <li>How to recall dreams
    <ul>
      <li>Get plenty of sleep</li>
      <li>Set an alarm clock to wake you when you are likely dreaming (bedtime + 90n; [4.5,6,7.5,9])</li>
      <li>Upon awaking:
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t move for at least 5min</li>
          <li>Don’t think about day’s concerns</li>
          <li>“What was I dreaming?”</li>
          <li>“What was I just thinking?”</li>
          <li>“How was I just feeling?”</li>
          <li>“What happened before that?”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Keep a dream journal
        <ul>
          <li>Use a dedicated notebook you like</li>
          <li>Describe all the senses and your emotional reactions, especially noting anything unusual</li>
          <li>Note the date, a catchy title, the dream, and do dream exercises</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dreamsigns
    <ul>
      <li>We invent explanations for the strange things in dreams</li>
      <li>We each have individual dreamsigns</li>
      <li>Categories
        <ul>
          <li>Inner awareness - things happening within yourself (e.g. thoughts, feelings)
            <ul>
              <li>Thoughts, Emotions, Sensations, Perceptions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Action - activities and motions of everything in the dream world
            <ul>
              <li>Ego action, Character action, Object action</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Form - The shapes of things, people, and places
            <ul>
              <li>Ego role, Character role, Character place, Object place, Setting place, Setting time, Situation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context - The combination of these things can be odd</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How to schedule for best results
    <ul>
      <li>Probability of lucid dreaming increases each REM period</li>
      <li>Extend your sleep (by several hours)</li>
      <li>Rearrange sleep (polyphasic) - wake up for two hours; the delayed sleep will have more REM than if it were continuous</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Master relaxation (see exercises)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-waking-up-in-the-dream-world-1">3. Waking Up in the Dream World</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prerequisites: recall one dream per night, have at least a dozen dreams recorded, identify dreamsigns</li>
  <li>Different techniques work for different people</li>
  <li>State testing = using critical faculty to assess if in a dream
    <ul>
      <li>Try to fly - hop in the air; if you stay airborne longer than usual then you are dreaming</li>
      <li>Re-read - read some writing or look at a digital clock face, look away, and look back; if the writing is different, then you are dreaming</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Important to train this critical faculty and bring it into the dream state</li>
  <li>Lucid dreaming rarely occurs without our intending it</li>
  <li>MILD
    <ul>
      <li>Prospective memory = remembering future intentions (without external reminders)
        <ul>
          <li>If you are motivated, you are likely to remember prospectively</li>
          <li>Activates a part of the brain that stays active until goal is achieved (like computer thread)</li>
          <li>Also helps to form mental associations (triggers) between the circumstances and what we want to do</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Prerequisite: remember to do things while awake (without external reminder)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Autosuggestion
    <ul>
      <li>PHS = posthypnotic suggestion</li>
      <li>Not as effective as MILD, so only useful if you don’t want to put in effort</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>External triggers
    <ul>
      <li>Audio (e.g. “You are dreaming”)</li>
      <li>Vibration</li>
      <li>Light - mask with red LED lights (Most effective)
        <ul>
          <li>Appears as 1. Unchanged incorporations…. 2. Incorporations as dream imagery…. 3. Incorporations as light superimposed on dream scene…. 4. Incorporation as a pattern superimposed on scene…. 5. Incorporation as pulsation in the dream scene</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Most effective combination: MILD and external stimulus</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-falling-asleep-consciously-1">4. Falling Asleep Consciously</h3>
<ul>
  <li>DILD = Dream Initiated Lucid Dream</li>
  <li>WILD = Wake Initiated Lucid Dream
    <ul>
      <li>This is accomplished by maintaining consciousness while falling asleep (or during short awakenings during the night)</li>
      <li>Focus on:
        <ul>
          <li>Hypnagogic imagery (e.g. images, flashes of light, geometric patterns –&gt; faces, people –&gt; scenes)</li>
          <li>Deliberate visualizations (e.g. symbols)
            <ul>
              <li>Lotus - the process of spiritual unfoldment</li>
              <li>Flame - our awareness</li>
              <li>Throat chakra - regulates sleep and wakefulness</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Your breath or heartbeat or body (side note: sleep paralysis is harmless)</li>
          <li>Any cognitive process that requires minimal but conscious effort (e.g. count self to sleep)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Proportion of WILD increases throughout the night</li>
      <li>Less frequent than WILD, but more potential for improvement</li>

<h3 id="1-the-world-of-lucid-dreaming-2">1. The World of Lucid Dreaming</h3>
<h4 id="your-present-state-of-consciousness">Your Present State of Consciousness</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Look</strong> - Become aware of what you see: notice the richly varied and vivid impressions –shapes, colors, movement, dimensionality, the entire visible world.</li>
  <li><strong>Listen</strong> - Become aware of what you hear: register the various sounds taken in by your ears – a diverse range of intensities, pitches, and tonal qualities, perhaps including the commonplace miracle of speech or the wonder of music.</li>
  <li><strong>Feel</strong> - Become aware of what you touch: texture (smooth, rough, dry, sticky, or wet), weight (heavy, light, solid, or empty), pleasure, pain, heat and cold, and the rest. Also note how your body feels right now and compare that to the many other ways it feels at other times, tired or energetic, stiff or limber, painful or pleasant, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Taste</strong> - Become aware of what it is like to taste: taste a number of different foods and substances, or remember and vividly imagine their tastes.</li>
  <li><strong>Smell</strong> - Become aware of what you smell: the odor of warm bodies, earth, incense, smoke, perfume, coffee, onions, alcohol, and the sea. Remember and imagine as many of them as you can.</li>
  <li><strong>Breathing</strong> - Attend to your breathing. A moment ago you probably were not consciously aware of your breathing even though you have inhaled and exhaled fifty times while doing this exercise. Hold your breath for a few seconds. Let it out. Now take a deep breath. Notice that being conscious of your breathing allows you to alter it deliberately.</li>
  <li><strong>Emotions</strong> - Become aware of your feelings. Remember the difference between anger and joy, serenity and excitement, and as many other emotions as you care to feel. How real do emotions feel?</li>
  <li><strong>Thoughts</strong> - Become aware of your thoughts. What have you been thinking while doing this exercise? What are you thinking right now? How real do thoughts seem?</li>
  <li><strong>“I”</strong> - Become aware of the fact that your world always includes you. As William James noted, it is I see, I hear, I feel, I think that is the basic fact of experience. You are not what you see, hear, think, or feel; you have these experiences. Perhaps most essentially, you are who is aware. You are always at the center of your multidimensional universe of experience, but you are not always consciously aware of yourself. Briefly repeat the exercise with the following difference: At the same time you attend to each of the various aspects of your experience, be aware that it is you who is noticing these things (“I see the light…”).</li>
  <li><strong>Awareness of awareness</strong> - Finally, become aware of your awareness. Normally, awareness focuses on objects outside ourselves, but it can itself be an object of awareness. In the light of ordinary experience, we seem to be distinct and limited centers of awareness, each alone in our inner worlds. In the light of eternity, mystics tell us, we are ultimately all one – the unlimited awareness that is the source of being. Here, experience cannot be adequately expressed by language.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2-preparation-for-learning-lucid-dreaming-2">2. Preparation for Learning Lucid Dreaming</h3>
<h4 id="cataloging-your-dreamsigns">Cataloging your dreamsigns</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Keep a dream journal</strong> - Record your dreams. Proceed to the next step after collecting a dozen dreams.</li>
  <li><strong>Catalog your dreamsigns</strong> - While continuing to collect dreams, mark the dreamsigns.</li>
  <li><strong>Classify each dreamsign using the dreamsign inventory</strong> - Next to each dreamsign on your list, write the name of its category from the dreamsign inventory.</li>
  <li><strong>Pick target dreamsign categories</strong> - Count how many times each dreamsign category (inner awareness, action, form, or context) occurs and rank them by frequency. Whichever occurs most often will be your target dreamsign category in the next step. If there is a tie between categories, pick the one that appeals to you.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice looking for dreamsigns while you are awake</strong> - Make a habit of examining your daily life for events that fit under your dreamsign category. For instance, if your target category is action, study how you, other people, animals, objects, and machines act and move. Become thoroughly familiar with the way things usually are in waking life. This will prepare you to notice when something unusual happens in a dream.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="goal-setting-for-success">Goal setting for success</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Set explicit, specific, and numerical goals</strong> - e.g. remember x dreams per night</li>
  <li><strong>Set difficult but realistic goals</strong> - e.g. x dreams, learn how to fly</li>
  <li><strong>Set short-range as well as long-range goals</strong> - e.g. perform a number of tests each day, x lucid dreams per month, learn how to fly by x</li>
  <li><strong>Record and evaluate your progress</strong> - Do it.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="scheduling-time-for-lucid-dreaming">Scheduling time for lucid dreaming</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Set your alarm</strong> - Set it 2-3 hour before your normal time</li>
  <li><strong>Get out of bed promptly in the morning</strong> - Get out of bed immediately</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on your intentions for your lucid dreams</strong> - A half hour before returning to sleep, focus your intentions on what you want to accomplish (e.g. where you want to go, whom you want to see, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Return to bed and practice an induction technique</strong> - Ensure you will be undisturbed for the next few hours. Go to bed and practice the induction technique that works best for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Give yourself at least two hours to sleep</strong> - Lucid dreaming is more likely now, so enjoy (you can even practice WILD here)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="progressive-relaxation">Progressive relaxation</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Lie down on a firm surface</strong> - Close your eyes and relax</li>
  <li><strong>Attend to your breathing</strong> - Pay attention to your breathing and allow it to deepen</li>
  <li><strong>Progressively tense and relax each muscle group</strong> - Tense and then relax all the muscle groups in your body, one at a time. Hold it tight for five to ten seconds.</li>
  <li><strong>Let go of all tension</strong> - After you have worked through all muscle groups, let them go limp.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="sixty-one-point-relaxation">Sixty-one-point relaxation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(See the book for this one; it’s essentially a body scan)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-waking-up-in-the-dream-world-2">3. Waking Up in the Dream World</h3>
<h4 id="critical-state-testing-technique">Critical state-testing technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Plan when to test your state</strong> - Pick five to ten different occasions during the day to test your state. These should be circumstances that are similar in some ways to your dreams. Any time you come in contact with something that resembles a dreamsign, test your state. Whenever anything surprising or unlikely occurs or anytime you experience unusually powerful emotions, or anything dream like, test your state. If you have recurrent dreams, any situations related to the recurrent content are ideal.</li>
  <li><strong>Test your state</strong> - Ask yourself the critical question as often as possible (at least the five to ten specific times you selected in Step 1): “Am I dreaming or awake?” Don’t just automatically ask the question and mindlessly reply, “Obviously, I’m awake,” or you will do the same thing when you actually are dreaming. Look around for any oddities or inconsistencies that might indicate you are dreaming. Think back to the events of the last several minutes. Do you have any trouble remembering what just happened? If so, you may be dreaming.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="power-of-resolution-technique">Power of resolution technique</h4>
<p>Goal: “resolving to maintain unbroken continuity of consciousness” throughout both the waking and dream states.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Day practice</strong> - During the day, think continuously that “all things are of the substance of dreams”</li>
  <li><strong>Night practice</strong> - Before sleep, resolve that you will comprehend the dream state.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="intention-technique">Intention technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Resolve to recognize dreaming</strong> - Upon awakening or immediately prior to sleep, clearly and confidently affirm your intention to remember to recognize the dream state.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualize yourself recognizing dreaming</strong> - Imagine as vividly as possible that you are in dream situations which would typically cause you to realize that you are dreaming. Incorporate several of your most frequently occurring or favorite dreamsigns in your visualizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Imagine carrying out an intended dream action</strong> - Resolve to carry out some particular chosen action in the dream. A good choice would be an action that is itself a dreamsign. For example, see yourself flying in your dream and recognizing that you are dreaming. While doing this be sure to firmly resolve to recognize the next time you are dreaming.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="reflection-intention-technique">Reflection-intention technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Plan when you intend to test your state</strong> - Choose in advance certain occasions when you intend to remember to test your state. For example, you might decide to ask, “Am I dreaming?” when you arrive home from work, at the beginning of each conversation you have, every hour on the hour, and so on. Choose a frequency of state testing that feels comfortable. Use imagery to help you remember to ask the question. For instance, if you intend to ask it when you arrive at home, see yourself opening the door and remembering your intention. Practice the exercise a dozen times or more during the day at your selected times and also whenever you find yourself in a situation which is in any way dreamlike, for example, whenever something surprising or odd happens or you experience inappropriately strong emotions or find your mind (and especially memory) strangely unresponsive.</li>
  <li><strong>Test your state</strong> - Ask yourself, “Am I dreaming or awake?” Look around you for any oddities or inconsistencies that might indicate you are dreaming. Think back to the events of the last several minutes. Do you have any trouble remembering what just happened? If so, you may be dreaming. Read some text twice. Don’t conclude that you are awake unless you have solid proof (for example, the writing stays the same every time you look at it).</li>
  <li><strong>Imagine yourself dreaming</strong> - After having satisfied yourself that you’re awake, ask yourself what it would be like if you were dreaming. Intently imagine that what you are perceiving (hearing, feeling, smelling, or seeing) is a dream. Observe your environment carefully for your target dreamsigns.</li>
  <li><strong>Imagine doing what you intend to do in your lucid dream</strong> - Decide in advance what you would like to do in your next lucid dream. Imagine experiencing doing whatever you have chosen to do. Firmly resolve that you will remember to recognize that you are dreaming and to do what you intend in your next lucid dream.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you establish a systematically critical attitude in your waking life, sooner or later you will decide to try a state test when you are actually dreaming. And then you will be awake in your dream.</p>

<h4 id="prospective-memory-training">Prospective memory training</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Read the day’s targets</strong> - The book includes target events (e.g. the next time I see/hear/do/feel X). When you get up in the morning, read only the targets for that day. (Do not read the targets before the proper day.) Memorize the day’s targets.</li>
  <li><strong>Look for your targets during the day</strong> - Each time you notice a target, ask yourself “Am I dreaming?” and perform a state test.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep track of how many target events you hit</strong> - Record number of targets hit. If you missed your first chance to notice a target, you failed to hit it. If you are certain the target did not happen, record that.</li>
  <li><strong>Continue the exercise for at least one week</strong> - If at the end of the week, you are still missing most of the targets, continue until you can hit most of them. Make up your own list of targets, keep track of your success rate, and observe how your memory develops.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="mild-technique">MILD technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Set up dream recall</strong> - Resolve to wake up and recall dreams during each dream period</li>
  <li><strong>Recall your dream</strong> - Try to recall as many details as possible from your dream (arouse yourself if you’re drifting back to sleep)</li>
  <li><strong>Focus your intent</strong> - While returning to sleep, concentrate single-mindedly on your intention to remember to recognize that you’re dreaming</li>
  <li><strong>See yourself becoming lucid</strong> - Imagine that you are back in your dream, but this time you recognize that it is a dream. Find a dreamsign in the experience; when you see it say to yourself: “I’m dreaming!” and continue your fantasy.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat</strong> - Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until your intention is set, then let yourself fall asleep. Repeat the procedure so that the last thing in your mind before falling asleep is your intention to remember to recognize the next time you are dreaming.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="autosuggestion-technique">Autosuggestion technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Relax completely</strong> - Relax, PMR, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Tell yourself that you will have a lucid dream</strong> - While remaining deeply relaxed, suggest to yourself that you are going to have a lucid dream, either later the same night or on some other night in the near future. Avoid putting intentional effort into your suggestion. Do not strongly insist with statements like “Tonight I will have a lucid dream!” You might find that if you don’t succeed after a night or two following such misplaced certainty, you will rapidly lose faith in yourself. Instead, attempt to put yourself in the frame of mind of genuinely expecting that you will have a lucid dream tonight or sometime soon. Let yourself think expectantly about the lucid dream you are about to have. Look forward to it, but be willing to let it happen all in good time.</li>

<h4 id="hypnagogic-imagery-technique">Hypnagogic imagery technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Relax completely</strong> - Let go of all muscular and mental tension, and breathe slowly and restfully (use PMR or 61-point relaxation if necessary).</li>
  <li><strong>Observe the visual images</strong> - Gently focus your attention on the visual images that will gradually appear…. watch without attachment or desire for action. The disconnected, fleeting patterns and images will gradually develop into scenes that become more and more complex, finally joining into extended sequences.</li>
  <li><strong>Enter the dream</strong> - When the imagery becomes a moving, vivid scenario, you should allow yourself to be passively drawn into the dream world. Do not try to actively enter the dream scene, but instead continue to take a detached interest in the imagery. Let your involvement with what is happening draw you into the dream. But be careful of too much involvement and too little attention. Don’t forget that you are dreaming now!</li>

<h4 id="count-yourself-to-sleep-technique">Count Yourself to Sleep Technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Relax completely</strong> - While lying in bed, gently close your eyes and relax your head, neck, back, arms, and legs. Completely let go of all muscular and mental tension, and breathe slowly and restfully.</li>
  <li><strong>Count to yourself while falling asleep</strong> - As you are drifting off to sleep, count to yourself, “1, I’m dreaming; 2, I’m dreaming,…” and so on, maintaining a degree of vigilance. You may start over after reaching 100 if you wish.</li>
  <li><strong>Realize you are dreaming</strong> - After continuing the counting and reminding process for some time, you will find that at some point, you’ll be saying to yourself, “I’m dreaming…, “ and you’ll notice that you are dreaming!</li>
</ol>

<p>“You can make rapid progress with this technique if you have someone watch over you while you fall asleep. Your assistant’s job is to wake you up whenever you show any sign of having fallen asleep, and to ask you what number you reached and what you were dreaming.
The watcher’s task may sound difficult, but in fact it’s quite easy to tell when you have fallen asleep. There are several observable signs of sleep onset: with dim light, you can observe the movement of the eyes under the closed lids. Slow pendular movements of the eyes from side to side are a reliable sign of sleep onset, as are minor movements or twitches of the lips, face, hands, feet, and other muscles. A third sign of sleep onset is irregular breathing.”</p>

<h4 id="the-twin-bodies-technique">The Twin Bodies Technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Relax completely</strong> - You know what to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on your body</strong> - Now focus your attention on your physical body…. Eventually you will experience sensations which will rapidly develop into complete paralysis of your physical body. At this stage you are ready to leave your paralyzed body behind and to enter the dream world in your dream body.</li>
  <li><strong>Leave your body and enter the dream</strong> - Remember that your currently paralyzed physical body has a magical, moveable twin, that is, your dream body, and that you can just as easily experience yourself as being in one body as the other. Let yourself peel free of the immobile physical body. Jump, fall, or crawl out of bed. Sit up or sink through the floor. Fly through the ceiling, or just get up. Now you’re in the world of lucid dreaming.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="the-one-body-technique">The One Body Technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Relax completely</strong> - You know what to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on your body</strong> - Same as above.</li>
  <li><strong>Leave your body and enter the dream</strong> - Remember that the body image you are currently experiencing as a paralyzed physical body cannot move (in mental space) because sensory information is telling your brain that your physical body is motionless. When sensory input is cut off (when you go deeper into REM sleep), there will be no information (except memory) indicating that your body is still in the position it was before. Now you are free to feel movement of your body image or dream body without any contradiction from your sensory systems. Your body image can move without reference to the actual position of your physical body, as it does naturally in dreams.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="the-no-body-technique">The No Body Technique</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Relax completely</strong> - You know what to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Think that you will soon no longer feel your body</strong> - While falling asleep, concentrate on the thought that when you fall asleep your body will become imperceptible.</li>
  <li><strong>Float freely about the dream as an ego-point</strong> - As soon as you can no longer feel your body, imagine that you are a point of awareness from which you perceive, feel, think, and act in the dream world.</li>
