## Review Previous Year
_This section is to help understand how you used your time, effort, and energy, and to identify the most and least valuable uses of those._

_First, review by memory and answer the following questions_

- Story
  - What were the plot points this past year? What did they mean? What was the overall story?
  - What am I proud of? What did I learn?
  - What story do I want to tell next year?

_Then review in detail_

- Review your Plan (Goals)
  - Did I complete these? Why or why not?
  - By the end of the year, were these what I actually cared about?
  - Which of these goals was I excited to work on? Why?
  - Which of these goals did I procrastinate on? Why?
- Review your Time (Calendar)
  - Without looking at your calendar, what was most memorable from last year? (highlights/lowlights)
  - What kinds of things were most memorable? Work? Social events? Time with certain people? Meeting new people? Feelings?
  - Now looking at your calendar, go through and catalog the events that were most memorable or valuable to you
  - What did I spend a lot of effort on that I don't care about?
  - Now generalize: what uses of time were most valuable, and what were least?
  - Which events or uses of time energized me? Why?
  - Which events or uses of time drained my energy? Why?
- Review your Experience (Photos, Journal)
  - Review the year in photos!

  - What were you most grateful for?
  - What was a painful lesson you learned?
  - What were you most proud of having accomplished?

For each of the above tools, note where you were in the previous year, where you want to be, and how you will get there. Questions to help you determine how to get there include:
- Do I have the right systems in place to achieve my goals? If not, what systems do I need to introduce?
- Are there potential sticking points you can foresee? If so, how will you avoid those?

Other useful questions
- What obstacle do I want to overcome?
- What would I do if I had 100 million in the bank?
