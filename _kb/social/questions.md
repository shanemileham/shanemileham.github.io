title: Conversation Questions
---

{% include toc %}

Note that statements are a great way to spark conversation as well.

Putting your attention on someone with genuinely interested questions allows them to reveal something they may not even have known about themselves.

<!-- [Common, Follow Up] -->

## Common starting points
- Where are you from? (location)
- Who do you know here? (connections)

## Generic Question Follow Ups
- Why?
- When was the last time you...?


< So you can organize by what information you want to obtain (psych profile) or by what feeling it evokes (inspiration, pride, fear/etc, neutral) >
