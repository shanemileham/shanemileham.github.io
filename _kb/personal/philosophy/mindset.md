Questions to ask self:
- how is this perfect?

- if you need more than one reason to do a thing then you're trying to convince yourself

- Do I want to be the person who did X or Y? Do I want to be the person in the future who has a history of doing hard action X?

Anticipate excuses and plan for them

Don't start a task until you're set up and won't be distracted by anything and promise to get through all of it at once
