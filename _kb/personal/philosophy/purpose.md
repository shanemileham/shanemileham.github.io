See Storytelling / hero's journey


Any myth worth its salt exerts a powerful magnetism. Notice the images and stories that you are drawn to and repelled by. Investigate the field of associated images and stories.

Some aspects of stories trigger deep senses of desire and need that pull us into them. Other aspects repel and repulse us. Like opposing and similar poles of two magnets, there is an invisible force that pulls and pushes with unseen power.

We want to feel like weâ€™re progressing always. We need a vision to have motivation.

Events are independent of meaning. Can apply meaning later.
- Example
  - Event = person singing badly
  - Story (context) one: I hate singing, have an important meeting tomorrow, and now I won't get good sleep and things will go badly
  - Story (context) two: I thought I was alone on this island - there must be someone else!
  - Story (context) three: I love that whoever is singing has the courage to sing so openly; that's beautiful.
