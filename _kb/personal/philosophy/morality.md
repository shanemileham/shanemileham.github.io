Belief: an ideal consistent moral system should have a memetic evolutionary advantage (that is, other people should adopt it, and it's effective at scale)

General notes
- Good/bad doesn't exist; and if they do, they require each other




Humans are in search of (limited?) Resources.
Having haves and have nots is an evolutionary advantage.
Reference Francis leaders post (and most people don't want to be leaders).
So ethically improving some people's competitive advantage doesn't have humanity and suffering as a whole.

The ethical things that help humanity are
Relieving suffering
Increasing resources
Finding symbiotic resource strategies
