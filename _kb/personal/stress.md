AXIOMS
Inefficiencies will persist in a system unless there is stress

Stress


Stress, break/identify weakest link, remove stress, recover and supercompensate

Flow states --> Recover then stress

- Total stress
- Antifragile
- Consistency is overrated
- Sleep according to stress (recovery depending on stress)
- Optimal stress zone (too much will break, too little will not adapt)
- Cycle for growth
- Learn how to recover, then how to stress.
- Consistency (no cycle) leads to no growth

Management += don't just make it possible to succeed; make it impossible to fail

Management += derisking = planning and overcoming psych biases --> Rationality


Retirement (laying on the beach) WILL make you bored (see flow state diagram)
