## Physical Fatigue

Reasons
- Muscular Fatigue
- Neural Fatigue
- Metabolic Fatigue
- Endocrine Fatigue
- Immune Fatigue
- (Mental Fatigue)

General recovery
- Sleep / nap
- Overall health


## Muscular Fatigue

## Neural Fatigue


from /fatigue
The central component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of serotonin in the central nervous system.[8] During motor activity, serotonin released in synapses that contact motoneurons promotes muscle contraction.[9] During high level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases and a spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the axon initial segment of motoneurons with the result that nerve impulse initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.[10]



### How the CNS works


### CNS Fatigue

Notes
- High duration exercises (not high intensity) >> CNS Fatigue
  - CNS improvement is required for long workouts
- High intensity / musculature is indepnenden of CNS Fatigue
- CNS Recovery takes minutes (~20min) ; PNS takes longer
- CNS fatigue affects your whole body
- CNS fatigue >> bad balance >> inefficient motion >> injury

Causes
- {{seretonin, dopamine, acetylcholine levels}}
- Compromised immune system
- Inadequate sleep
- Inadequate nutrition

Post-exercise: Fatigue will almost always be present to some degree and this degree will be variable depending on multiple factors.
Following heavy training: There will most likely be some level of neural fatigue, but to claim it’s all focused around “CNS Fatigue” may be too broad/overreaching.
Peripheral fatigue may be more present during the times of fatigue following exercise compared to the CNS or central fatigue.
It’s been suggested that the CNS (in general) is geared to and tends to recover quickly and super-compensate after stressful occasions.
Deadlifts don’t necessarily cause more CNS fatigue compared to a squat, and major muscle group usage may be one suggestion to predict various levels of CNS and peripheral fatigue post-heavy compounds.
In literature, most (if not all) neural & resistance training focused studies have focused on acute instances, and there’s a lack of long timeline research.
It’s important to build your own definition of fatigue.
