## Neural Fatigue


from /fatigue
The central component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of serotonin in the central nervous system.[8] During motor activity, serotonin released in synapses that contact motoneurons promotes muscle contraction.[9] During high level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases and a spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the axon initial segment of motoneurons with the result that nerve impulse initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.[10]
