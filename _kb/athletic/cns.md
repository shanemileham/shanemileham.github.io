1. Low intensity / high duration >> more CNS fatigue
2. Amount of musculature involved barely relates to CNS fatigue
3. It only takes minutes to recover


If you tear a hamstring, that wonâ€™t inherently affect your quadriceps. In contrast, CNS fatigue can affect your entire body.


Low intensity, high duration exercise causes far more central fatigue than short, high intensity exercise [2, 3, 4].

CNS fatigue is readily observed after endurance exercise, like marathons, but scientists often really have to go out of their way to reliably induce central nervous system fatigue with strength training


CNS improvement is required for long workouts

In conclusion, the research does not show any relation between the amount of musculature involved in an exercise and the amount of CNS fatigue it induces

CNS recovers within minutes

CNS Fatigue >> injury


CNS Fatigue >> bad balance >> inefficient motion


?? Verify - The nervous system uses about 20% of the bodies available glucose and oxygen, that fact alone tells just how important it is in strength work. Without the CNS nothing happens.


### How to recover
Sleep
psychological healing
