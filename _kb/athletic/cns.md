## CNS Fatigue

If you tear a hamstring, that wonâ€™t inherently affect your quadriceps. In contrast, CNS fatigue can affect your entire body.


Low intensity, high duration exercise causes far more central fatigue than short, high intensity exercise [2, 3, 4].

CNS fatigue is readily observed after endurance exercise, like marathons, but scientists often really have to go out of their way to reliably induce central nervous system fatigue with strength training


CNS improvement is required for long workouts

In conclusion, the research does not show any relation between the amount of musculature involved in an exercise and the amount of CNS fatigue it induces

CNS recovers within minutes
