title: Balance

## Definition

In biomechanics, balance is an ability to maintain the line of gravity (vertical line from centre of mass) of a body within the base of support with minimal postural sway.


### Notes from Wikipedia
Maintaining balance requires coordination of input from multiple sensory systems including the vestibular, somatosensory, and visual systems.[3]
- Vestibular system: sense organs that regulate equilibrium (equilibrioception); directional information as it relates to head position (internal gravitational, linear, and angular acceleration)
- Somatosensory system: senses of proprioception and kinesthesia of joints; information from skin and joints (pressure and vibratory senses); spatial position and movement relative to the support surface; movement and position of different body parts relative to each other
- Visual system: Reference to verticality of body and head motion; spatial location relative to objects

There are environmental factors that can affect balance such as light conditions, floor surface changes, alcohol, drugs, and ear infection.

Ankle sprains are one of the most frequently occurring injuries among athletes and physically active people. The most common residual disability post ankle sprain is instability along with body sway.

requires muscular strength too, especially in hips and knees

Since balance is a key predictor of recovery (WHERE?)



 So far, researchers have only been able to estimate that athletes need anywhere from 8â€“20 minutes of rest before testing balance[25][26][27]
