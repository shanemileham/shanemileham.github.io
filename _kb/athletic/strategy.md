## Strategic beliefs / notes
- Train recovery, psych, neuromuscular first (in comparison to strength/endurance/metabolic)
  - These things don't atrophy quickly
  - They take longer to train



- Strength before endurance
- Balance before strength
- He who recovers faster iterates faster
- He who iterates faster makes more progress (compounding)
- Balance --> strength --> endurance
- Recovery ({meditation, dance, ...}) --> more iterations --> more progress
- Stress in any area of life hinders recovery. Become capable in every area so you don't have unplanned nonrecovery.

- High levels will require expert programming in attributes above

- Outsource (hire) wherever needed
- Best to have

- Neuromuscular first
  - Don't lose the ability over time / doesn't atrophy quickly (unlike strength, metabolic)
  -

stress is overall. be able to handle a lot of stress. then you can lower that stress and handle more physically.
