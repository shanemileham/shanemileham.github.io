{% include toc %}

## Goals
- Optimal mental and athletic performance
- Ability to lucid dream
- Minimal sleep required while attaining the above


## Questions
- What is the best sleep schedule?
- How do you get good quality sleep?
- Is sleep reduction really okay? Does it hinder optimal physical performance?
- Under what conditions is taking a red-eye flight okay?
- How do you best entrain your circadian rhythm?
- What is the effect of a polyphasic sleep cycle with a phase response curve of the circadian rhythm or the application of melatonin?


## What is sleep?
- Sleep is typically characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity

## Importance of Sleep
"Chronic sleep deficiency, defined as a state of inadequate or mistimed sleep, is a growing and underappreciated determinant of health status. Sleep deprivation contributes to a number of molecular, immune, and neural changes that play a role in disease development, independent of primary sleep disorders. These changes in biological processes in response to chronic sleep deficiency may serve as etiological factors for the development and exacerbation of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and, ultimately, a shortened lifespan. Sleep deprivation also results in significant impairments in cognitive and motor performance which increase the risk of motor vehicle crashes and work-related injuries and fatal accidents. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society have developed this statement to communicate to national health stakeholders the current knowledge which ties sufficient sleep and circadian alignment in adults to health." ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3353049/))

## Axioms / Optimizations
- Different stressors (e.g. workouts, work, social situations) require different types and amounts of sleep
- Deeper sleep at beginning of night ([Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest-activity_cycle))


## Effectors
- Physical Exercise
  - Moderate aerobic exercise decreases sleep onset latency and total wake time, and it increases sleep efficiency and total sleep time. High-intensity aerobic exercise and moderate-intensity resistance exercise had little effect ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883039/))
  - "an acute bout of exercise is likely to result in a modest improvement in the subsequent night's sleep" "the largest increases in TST were seen with exercise longer than 60 minutes. The mode of exercise performed (e.g., walking, resistance exercise) and participant's level of fitness generally were not significant moderators" "According to a meta-analysis, exercising 4-8 h prior to bedtime has the most robust effects on subsequent sleep" ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/))
  - Increased duration and increased intensity both improve sleep quality ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/)), but I believe this is because your body has more to recover from and has to be more efficient
- Temperature
  - sleep onset typically coincides with the rapid decline in body temperature and exercise increases the rate of decline in body temperature by initially raising core body temperature ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/))
- Nutrients
- Stress
  - "Psychosocial stress is associated with increased pre-sleep arousal and impaired sleep"
  - "Various stress management strategies have been shown to reduce pre-sleep arousal and improve sleep (most often self-reported sleep)"
  - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/
- Noise
  - Nighttime noise increases arousals, but habituation to noises occurs ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/))
- Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, ... ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/))


## Sleep Hyiene
Note: "Although research has demonstrated links between individual sleep hygiene components and subsequent sleep, evidence for the efficacy of sleep hygiene education as a treatment for insomnia has been limited and inconclusive" ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/))

## Circadian Rhythm


## Polyphasic Sleep
AFAIK, this is suboptimal for athletic performance. Need to verify.

## Dreaming
See notes on lucid dreaming in other doc

- REM deprivation is highly successful as an antidepressant
  - Results suggested (1) that substantial REM sleep reduction has antidepressant activity, and (2) since imipramine and other drug antidepressants reduce REM sleep much more so than nonantidepressant drugs, that an antidepressant "mechanism" of drugs resides in their capacity to substantially reduce REM sleep. ([Source](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/491375))
  - REM sleep alterations may precede the clinical expression of depression ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23391633))



## Myths
- "Morning" and "Evening" people
  - "Morning" and "Evening" people are determined by questions like "What time would you get up if you were entirely free to plan your day?" ([reference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningness%E2%80%93eveningness_questionnaire)). There is some genetic influence on these preferences. However, people perform the same on cognitive tests regardless of their morning/evening preference and time of the day. [Chronotype](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype). Humans can have a propensity to be morning people or evening people; these behavioral preferences are called chronotypes for which there are various assessment questionnaires and biological marker correlations.
- Melatonin helps you fall asleep
  - It actually is a signal to alter the circadian rhythm (see section on Circadian Rhythm)
- Blue light
  - It's not bad - it simply acts as an entrainment mechanism for the circadian rhythm (see section on Circadian Rhythm)
- Exercise and sleep disruption
  - "Current evidence does not support the claim that late-night exercise disrupts sleep" "According to a meta-analysis, exercising 4-8 h prior to bedtime has the most robust effects on subsequent sleep compared to all other times of day... studies have also found that exercising within 4 hours of bedtime does not disrupt or even improves subsequent sleep. These results were achieved even though exercise induced increases in heart rate and core body temperature that, in some cases, remained elevated at bedtime. These findings were further confirmed by a recent epidemiologic survey of 1000 adults which reported that nighttime exercise was not associated with poor sleep. Thus, the available evidence does not support the claim that late-night exercise disturbs sleep in the general population." ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/))
- Naps
  - "Most research suggests that daytime naps do not have a substantial impact on subjective or objective nocturnal sleep, despite sleep hygiene recommendations to avoid naps" ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/))
- Sleep timing
  - "Irregular sleep schedules have been associated with poor sleep, but assigning regular sleep schedules to nonclinical adults has shown limited effects on sleep improvement" ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/))


## Statements to Verify
- Warmth --> Awake; Cold --> Asleep
  - Note that metabolizing carbohydrates will create heat, which will signal your body to wake up. This is perfect for naps and suboptimal if long sleep is desired.
- Employ the use of deep belly breathing before sleep.
- Use calcium and magnesium instead of melatonin for help with falling asleep and staying asleep.
