{% include toc %}

## Goals
- Optimal mental and athletic performance
- Ability to lucid dream
- Minimal sleep while attaining the above

## Axioms
- Sleep is typically characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity


## Statements To Organize
- Experimental data of sleep waves (deeper sleep at beginning of night) --> [basic rest-activity cycle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest-activity_cycle)
- "Morning" and "Evening" people are determined by questions like "What time would you get up if you were entirely free to plan your day?" ([reference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningness%E2%80%93eveningness_questionnaire)). There is some genetic influence on these preferences. However, people perform the same on cognitive tests regardless of their morning/evening preference and time of the day. [Chronotype](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype). Humans can have a propensity to be morning people or evening people; these behavioral preferences are called chronotypes for which there are various assessment questionnaires and biological marker correlations.
- Moderate Aerobic exercise decreases sleep onset latency and total wake time, and it increases sleep efficiency and total sleep time. High-intensity aerobic exercise and moderate-intensity resistance exercise had little effect ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883039/))



## Statements to Verify



- No food or alcohol within 2-4 hours of bedtime. If you must eat, eat low carbohydrate. The sugar from alcohol and carbohydrate will metabolize in the middle of your sleep causing a rise in body temperature, signaling the body to wake.
- Employ the use of deep belly breathing before sleep.
- Keep the room cold in the evening to signal the body to slow down.
- Use calcium and magnesium instead of melatonin for help with falling asleep and staying asleep.

## Things I've Verified Experimentally
- Different behaviors/workouts require different amount of sleep
- it’s more important to wake up at the same time than fall asleep at the same time
- Easier to fly E-->W, Circadian rhythm is over 24 hours

## Questions
- What is the best sleep schedule?
- How do you get good quality sleep?
- Is sleep reduction really okay? Does it hinder optimal physical performance?
- Under what conditions is taking a red-eye flight okay?
- How do you best entrain your circadian rhythm?
- What is the effect of a polyphasic sleep cycle with a phase response curve of the circadian rhythm or the application of melatonin?

## Outline
- What is sleep
- Effects
- Optimizations
- Polyphasic, etc.
- Dreaming
