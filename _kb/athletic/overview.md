OVERVIEW OF MY PLAN AND AXIOMS

## Beliefs / Hypotheses
- Strength before endurance
- Balance before strength
- He who recovers faster iterates faster
- He who iterates faster makes more progress

- Balance --> strength --> endurance
- Recovery ({meditation, dance, ...}) --> more iterations --> more progress

Stress in area of life hinders recovery. Become capable in every area so you don't have unplanned nonrecovery.
