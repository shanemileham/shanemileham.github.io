## Part 0 - Program Design

### Axioms
<!-- 19. Periodization -->
<!-- 20. Rehab -->
Specificity of adaptation
Weakest link theory (+ each sport stresses links differently, so want to profile accordingly)
Training = Stress and recover
Training is the process of applying calculated stress to the body and providing the conditions necessary to adapt. In short, training consists of stress and recovery. The applied stress evokes a specific adaptation, and when training for a goal, it is important to know what physiological systems you want to stress and consequently improve.

_Each successive level will investigate one link in the chain and ways to optimize_

## Part 1 - How to Stress the Body

### Biomechanics and Neuromuscular Control (Technique)
<!-- 1. (Muscular, Neuromuscular) -->
<!-- 4. Biomechanics -->
- Biomechanics --> train with the right form
- How to train biomechanics effectively, stretching

### Bioenergetics
<!-- 1. (Cardiovascular, Respiratory) -->
<!-- 2. Bioenergetics -->
Bioenergetics --> train specific to metabolic pathways (affects sets/reps)

### Mobility

### Strength

### Endurance


## Part 2 - How to Recover
Goal: return to homeostasis and supercompensate

[Supercompensation (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercompensation)

### Nutrition
<!-- 10. Nutrition -->
Returns you to homeostasis

### Endocrine System
<!-- 3. Endocrine -->
Now that we have the building blocks for what to stress, this is how you recover


## Part 3 - How to Train (+Exercises)
### General
<!-- 13. Warmup and Stretching -->

### Anaerobic
<!-- 5. Anaerobic -->
<!-- 14. Resistance Training Technique -->
<!-- 15. Resistance -->
<!-- 16. Plyometric -->
<!-- 17. Speed and Agility -->

### Aerobic
<!-- 6. Aerobic -->
<!-- 18. Aerobic -->


## Part 4 - Training for Specific Populations

### For Athletes
<!-- 8. Psychology -->
<!-- 9. Performance Enhancing Substances -->

### For Coaches

<!-- 11. Test Selection -->
<!-- 12. Test Administration -->

### For Women and Children
