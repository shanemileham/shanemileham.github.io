- Only make promises you can keep
- Create alignment with all stakeholders about all expectations
- You can assign a task, but you can't assign ownership. For that you need buy-in.
- Build the relationships; build the alignment; build the trust
- “The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place. “
