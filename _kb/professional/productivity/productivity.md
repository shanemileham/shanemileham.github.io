## Definition

Of all the things you have to do, doing the highest leverage (most important)

![Eisenhower Matrix](https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/eisenhower-box.jpg)


## Principles
- Visibility - everything in one place so you can know what you have to do
- Prioritization - know what is most important so you can do what is most important


## Setup Actionables

### Calendar
0. Choose your life categories that matter and color code them (e.g. [grey=sleep/logistic, salmon=work, green=athletic, purple=mental, blue=social, yellow=creative, cyan=personal growth, default light blue = temporary])
1. Schedule 24hrs on calendar proactively
2. Keep track retroactively of how you spend your time
3. Asana += Weekly task to review how you spent your time vs how you want to spend it
4. Asana += Daily task for schedule ([morning routine, work, workout,

### Email
1. Is this a task? If so, add to your task management solution (e.g. send to x@mail.asana.com)
2. Do I need to reply? If so, reply (include link to asana maybe)
3. Archive

### Asana
1. Prioritize - tag (tab+t) all projects from [p0, p1, p2, p3]
  - P0 (Red) - rare - things you have to do under any circumstance - don’t use much - interruptor
  - P1 (Red/Orange) - physical training, going to do, planning on it
  - P2 (Orange) - do it when able
  - P3 (Yellow) - nice to haves
  - Anything else, nix
2. Create projects based on your life categories ([athletic, mental, social, creative, personal growth]) and move all tasks to a category
3. Schedule repeating time on your calendar for each of your life categories, during which time you work through those tasks


## Execution Actionables

1. Centralize - add all tasks to one place
2. Prioritize - know the order of importance
3. Contextualize - know the order which will be fastest (e.g. minimize context switching)
  - Categories
  - Places
4. Execute - do the tasks! (in order)



## Tips (unordered)
- ONLY habit you need is checking your daily routine task, and the task can include anything you need to do daily. Any habit additions can happen by simply adding to the daily routine
  - {{example}}
- Synchronize calendar and tasks >> put yours tasks on your calendar
- Commitment to Winning - Decide tasks you'll accomplish during the day ahead of time, and confirm this is possible by scheduling the tasks
- Pomodoro technique
  - See Reset doc
- If something is wrong, change the system or change the habit. Rarely a problem with the person. People have good intentions.
- Always do the task while you are in the context, in the mindset, on the call. Do it all then.




### Task Management
- Eliminate
- Delegate
- Automate
- Prioritize
- Do



## Notes
- See Management KB doc


## Routines
- Great way to use habits
- Make sure they align with environment (too strict will fail in a changing environment)
- Can be a great marker of overload (missing things if life gets too stressful)

## Ander's Notes

Other notes
- Plan vs reality -> change habit
- Routines and spontaneity
- Any idea, task, thought --> go into asana
- Sections in asana = sequential and atomic
- Management += entire project planned at front

##Chelsea’s Notes

Calendar
Logging all time - sleep and activity/task
Record all the activities and record the estimate time and then after the day, record the actual time you spent doing the activities
Color code based on activity type
Either block on your calendar for “asana tasks” or block each individual task - but put something in your calendar
The goal is to live towards your ideal day - and you can’t estimate what your time is going to look like unless you record it and see it - so budgeting time and tracking time to optimize your day - you can more effectively hit goals
Even block out time to relax and hang out with people

Phone doesn’t distract you
Follow desires
Love your work so much that you can effectively act on desire when fun things pop up
Can look at week and view the colors to optimize the proportions
Limit texting and instead call or use voice to be present

For every task set a calendar block (min half hour)
10 tasks for the day at 30 min is 5 hours - if you finish early great
Record how you actually live your life verses how you want to live it

Weekly task: pop up once a week into your asana
Monthly task: once a month pop up - repeating tasks

Want every task into asana
Can divert emails to asana by having people reply to or comment on asana tasks in work week
Forward emails to x@mail.asana.com (mail forwarding to asana which automatically assigns it as a task)
Go through emails and either reply or forward to asana
If future task is required, put into asana and reply with link to new task saying you will get to it

Tons of tasks in asana - now need to prioritize
Urgent v Important
What is the penalty if i don’t do this thing - question the urgency
Really focus on the important tasks - don’t even look at the urgent
P0, 1, 2, 3

Task switching can be tiring
Organize into categories
Different project for each category related to your calendar with same colors
Which things to automate, which to delegate

Organization of projects
Lists and Boards
Go with lists most of the time
Boards: with things that are of equal importance that can be done in parallel or for moving across statuses

Scheduling
Want a block in your calendar for each of the projects
Each color should be represented on your calendar (correlated to projects)
Highlighting 3-5 tasks a day that need to get done -- if I finish these 3 tasks, I will be happy for the day -- always want to have 3 because otherwise you won’t get anything important done - rewards you for doing things faster
Can go to sleep knowing you have won that day. You can also trust your future self that you will get shit done and never drop the ball. You don’t have to respond right away - it funnels into your email.

Personal Use

Decisions are the greatest obstacle of time - they take the most time - that gray space between what you want to do and how to do it
If someone fails on something twice, cc their manager with the shared task needed to be done, create the pattern and habit of the task that needs to get done



ORGANZATION
Asana + Calendar + Goals

Task management
Taking control of your schedule
Goals
Folder setup

We act to maximize pleasure and minimize pain.
Everything we do moves us forward.
If you have a document and you don't plan on doing anything with it, it's not useful. It won't m/m.
