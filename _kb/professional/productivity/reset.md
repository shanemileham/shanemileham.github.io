## Flags
I know I'm not on my game when I...
- Have disorganization (space, email, asana, ...) for more than one day in a row
- Haven't planned out the next day
- Feel stressed
- Skip my workout
- Wakeup late or without an alarm
- Haven't meditated


## INPUT

What motivates me?
- Finding out what I am capable of (Exploring and Accomplishing)
- Being the kind of person I want to be (“I want to be the kind of person who…”)

Promises to myself
- Morning routine (wakeup, meditate, workout)
- Evening routine (plan next day, bonus: inbox zero)


I am allowed ONE rest day per week, and on that day I can do whatever I want.

I am allowed to sleep at any time. The goal is to live my waking life at 100%, but if that tires me out, that’s okay. Get sleep and recover. Naps are okay.
