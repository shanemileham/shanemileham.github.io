### Managing Projects


### Handling Issues
- Every issue can be solved at one of the following levels:
  - Systems (communication, expectations, technical, ...)
  - People (beliefs, habits, ...)

#### Understanding Issues
- Open: State issue, give examples, and invite the person to share ("Why do you think this is happening?")
- Summarize: "Let me make sure I understand you..." / "So what I hear you saying is..."
- Gather Information
  - Probe: Identify areas of question and ask open questions ("Tell me more.", "What else should I know?", "Why do you say that?", "For example?")
  - Temporarily Put Aside: "If we could resolve X, and I'm not saying we can, but if we could, are there any other reasons why you think Y is happening?"
- Repeat

#### Solving Issues
- Ask for solutions ("If you were me, what would you recommend?", "What ideas do you have?", "What would your solution be?")
- Respond to solution: accept, add, or question
- Create a plan to solve (What by Whom by When)


### Performance
- Set performance expectations for all workers
- Know performance status for all workers
- Know upward trajectory for all workers
- Know alignment and morale for all workers


## Overall Notes
- have time for your people
- talk to all your people
- learn their problems, show you care
- take notes
- do something concrete about it

If you need to alter a person's behavior, after aligning with them (to make sure they want that change), then follow the steps of Charles Duhigg's [How Habits Work](https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/).

## Exercises

### Spheres of Influence
For a given person you need something from, learn their world:
- Who they interact with
- What is expected of them
- What their incentives are
- What problems are they facing?
- How are they thinking about their problems?

Management += don't just make it possible to succeed; make it impossible to fail

Management += derisking = planning and overcoming psych biases --> Rationality

Context switching is expensive, especially for professions like engineering

Prioritization happens better with more data. Giving someone more work or less time makes them focus on priorities and pushing back more.
