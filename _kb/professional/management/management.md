### Managing Projects


### Handling Issues
- Every issue can be solved at one of the following levels:
  - Systems (communication, expectations, technical, ...)
  - People (beliefs, habits, ...)

#### Understanding Issues
- Open: State issue, give examples, and invite the person to share ("Why do you think this is happening?")
- Summarize: "Let me make sure I understand you..." / "So what I hear you saying is..."
- Gather Information
  - Probe: Identify areas of question and ask open questions ("Tell me more.", "What else should I know?", "Why do you say that?", "For example?")
  - Temporarily Put Aside: "If we could resolve X, and I'm not saying we can, but if we could, are there any other reasons why you think Y is happening?"
- Repeat

#### Solving Issues
- Ask for solutions ("If you were me, what would you recommend?", "What ideas do you have?", "What would your solution be?")
- Respond to solution: accept, add, or question
- Create a plan to solve (What by Whom by When)


### Performance
- Set performance expectations for all workers
- Know performance status for all workers
- Know upward trajectory for all workers
- Know alignment and morale for all workers


## Overall Notes
- have time for your people
- talk to all your people
- learn their problems, show you care
- take notes
- do something concrete about it

If you need to alter a person's behavior, after aligning with them (to make sure they want that change), then follow the steps of Charles Duhigg's [How Habits Work](https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/).

## Exercises

### Spheres of Influence
For a given person you need something from, learn their world:
- Who they interact with
- What is expected of them
- What their incentives are
- What problems are they facing?
- How are they thinking about their problems?

Management += don't just make it possible to succeed; make it impossible to fail

Management += derisking = planning and overcoming psych biases --> Rationality

Context switching is expensive, especially for professions like engineering

Prioritization happens better with more data. Giving someone more work or less time makes them focus on priorities and pushing back more.

Tell me anything that's not on track (requires believability)

Instead of saying "Tech Debt", explain it in terms of outcomes. Even metaphors of outcomes (leak in the boat... we can only sustain a few more, and eng hours are going to fix the leak) can help.


Don't need perfect alignment. Can smooth over later. I am decision maker. Few things are multiple rp. Don't dilute authority.

Tell people in advance the operating model.

Frame as feedback not vote. A voice an vote are different.

https://tomtunguz.com/disagree-and-commit/
Disagree and commit - Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?' By the time you're at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you'll probably get a quick yes."
Let people feel heard. Even if we don't go with it.

Things I can promise. To listen. To make decisions in best interest of company and team. Just make decisions and be okay with being wrong. Go fast.

Serve them through expediency
Alignment first. But sometimes expediency
Don't need consensus
Scale decision making


Know motivation of each team member. SWOT, one pager, intrinsic motivators, vision diff, ...

Understand people, projects, goal.


Always have someone driving. If you care deeply about the outcome, that person is you.

To client: set expectations of what they'll receive by when, even if the first thing they'll receive is a plan.
