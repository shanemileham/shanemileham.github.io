## Summary


## Pros
Pros of Remote
- Requires better comms
- Worldwide talent
- Lower cost for talent
- Don't need to pay for an office
- Working alone minimizes distractions and improves productivity
- All communication is by choice. People want to talk with you. People are never talking to you to fill the time.
- Communication is purposeful
- Presence - when people are there, they are present. If they need personal time, they can take it wherever they need. They can design their day or run errands.


## Cons

N+1 Management Problem
- Managers must be director-level skilled >> must be able to solve problems they can't see, inferred from results (not ones they can see in person)

Managing a Distributed Team
- Managing/noticing personal interactions and issues indirectly/via video

Junior People Problem
- Requires a ton of up-front management and constant questions difficult to provide remotely
- They don't want to ask that many questions via text/video to seem incapable / afraid to interrupt

Friction of Communication
- Less creativity
- Comm is inherently more lossy (only video, not physical)
- Doesn't allow simultaneous conversations
- People talk over each other << latency
- Requires interruption >> makes it harder for diverse teams (gender and otherwise)


From [James Shore](https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Three-Challenges-of-Distributed-Teams.html)
```
First, the cost of establishing communication is much higher, even when the technology works perfectly.

A: B, are you there?
B: Yes I am
A: Let’s chat
B: OK
A: (sets up video call)
A: (waits)
B: (joins call)
In comparison, in a co-located team, there’s no friction.

A: (turns head) B, I have a question.
```

Overall
- Less choice in hiring << need higher-level people
- Higher Costs << ROI of juniors is negative, and need to hire more people for same results
- Less creativity << more difficult conversations


## Hybrid

"Pod" Approach = Remote, but pods around the world
- Benefits of both
- Rapport exists
- Less costs
- Can still maintain remote/worldwide talent
- Don't need as much management skill
