## Summary

Could remote working be for anyone?
Anyone can do remote working. That doesn't mean all jobs can be remote of course. Jobs can range from tech, marketing, accounting, real estate, and more.

How do you think this will impact the workforce?
Moving towards a frictionless worldwide economy (see inv.tech ðŸ˜‰ ) will empower developing countries, encourage better communication in remote companies, and solve worldwide problems as the people who are most affected will have the power to solve their own problems. This will also encourage diversity of thinking (as remote companies spanning continents emerge) and worldwide empathy. So many more things too ðŸ™‚

How do you see the future of remote working?
INV product vision coming this week ðŸ˜‰ Everyone working in a global digital economy where they can sign on/off anytime and complete tasks for others. (Note the coasian friction which leads to organizational creation; this would minimize that).

How are companies responding to it?
Some are embracing worldwide talent sourcing, diversity of thinking, timezone advantages. Others aren't willing to put in the work and stay within their locale. Long term I believe companies who can master the advantages of diversity will win.

What problems does it solve?
Lifestyle >> no commute required (huge city benefits here, change to socialization structure, ...), ability to work while on the road or traveling, economic savings for workers, location independence (huge effects here for civilization), ...
Business >> worldwide talent pool, best perk available, diversity of thinking and representation, no costs for building overhead, ...

What problems does it have?
Management >> https://github.com/shanemileham/shanemileham.github.io/blob/master/_kb/professional/management/remote.md
Business >> communication needs to be next level (see above link), diversity of thinking requires/encourages better empathy

What do you think, could remote working be a solution for crisis countries like Greece. If they make money online, spend it in greece, boosting economy.
Absolutely. We almost targeted Greek workers for agents, but it wasn't quite the right economic fit yet. We have quite a few agents from Venezuela who are benefitting tremendously from this setup currently.

## Pros
Pros of Remote
- Requires better comms
- Worldwide talent
- Lower cost for talent
- Don't need to pay for an office
- Working alone minimizes distractions and improves productivity
- All communication is by choice. People want to talk with you. People are never talking to you to fill the time.
- Communication is purposeful
- Presence - when people are there, they are present. If they need personal time, they can take it wherever they need. They can design their day or run errands.


## Cons

N+1 Management Problem
- Managers must be director-level skilled >> must be able to solve problems they can't see, inferred from results (not ones they can see in person)

Managing a Distributed Team
- Managing/noticing personal interactions and issues indirectly/via video

Junior People Problem
- Requires a ton of up-front management and constant questions difficult to provide remotely
- They don't want to ask that many questions via text/video to seem incapable / afraid to interrupt

Friction of Communication
- Less creativity
- Comm is inherently more lossy (only video, not physical)
- Doesn't allow simultaneous conversations
- People talk over each other << latency
- Requires interruption >> makes it harder for diverse teams (gender and otherwise)


From [James Shore](https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Three-Challenges-of-Distributed-Teams.html)
```
First, the cost of establishing communication is much higher, even when the technology works perfectly.

A: B, are you there?
B: Yes I am
A: Letâ€™s chat
B: OK
A: (sets up video call)
A: (waits)
B: (joins call)
In comparison, in a co-located team, thereâ€™s no friction.

A: (turns head) B, I have a question.
```

Overall
- Less choice in hiring << need higher-level people
- Higher Costs << ROI of juniors is negative, and need to hire more people for same results
- Less creativity << more difficult conversations


## Hybrid

"Pod" Approach = Remote, but pods around the world
- Benefits of both
- Rapport exists
- Less costs
- Can still maintain remote/worldwide talent
- Don't need as much management skill
