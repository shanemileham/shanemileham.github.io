Asana for teams

## Fears / Perceived Problems

### Dropped balls / Ignored tasks

A delegates to B via asana. B doesn’t think it’s important, but doesn’t do it. The task doesn’t get done, and neither A nor B hold it as their responsibility.

Getting tasks that aren’t important. Noise, clutter, overload, …


### Doesn’t follow delegation protocol

(Should always come down hierarchy)
Fear is that non-managers will assign tasks, and that will break the hierarchy.


### Multiple systems
Right now we’re also using email as task management

If I delegate in asana, it won’t get done quickly. Because right now there are multiple systems.


## Solution space (how to use asana effectively)

### Delegation Protocol
- Can delegate up
- Can delegate down
- Can delegate to head of team


### Email
1. Is this a task? If so, forward to x@mail.asana.com (goes to my tasks)
  - You can also send it to the email for a specific project’s email address (e.g. `x+<PROJECTNUMBER>@mail.asana.com`) (you can get this from the project… add to your contacts once)
2. Do I need to reply? If so, reply (include link to asana maybe)
3. Archive


### Asana
One time
- Create own project named `<FIRST LAST>`

Daily
- Universal inbox = My Tasks (section: New Tasks)
- Add all new tasks to `<FIRST LAST>`
- Mark date
- Mark for later
- Prioritize - tag (tab+t) all projects from [p0, p1, p2, p3]


## FAQ

### When should something be a subtask?

Hierarchy: Portfolio > Project > Section > Task > Subtask

Ultimately, where info is placed is subjective in this hierarchy.
