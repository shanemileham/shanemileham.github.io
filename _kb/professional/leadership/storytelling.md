## Storytelling Overview

"We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one." -River Song

Anything can be a story. But it should be a story that we want to tell, or a story that someone wants to hear. Often we want it to be both and at scale.

What kind of stories do you want to tell? Depends on your intention. Some reasons are:
- Telling it makes you feel good
- You want to convey information
- You want to evoke emotion

Or someone might gain something from listening to a story
- Realize something similar going on in their life and learn
- Feel an emotion they want to feel (could even be fear like Horror movies) (be entertained)


---

- What is a story?
- Why are you telling a story? To whom? What do they want?
- What makes a story interesting/memorable?
- What questions can you ask to make someone else's story memorable?

“Think of a moment in which your own failures led to success in your career, or a lesson that a parent or mentor imparted,” says Sachs. “Any of these things can be interesting emotional entry points to a story.”


Any mythology worth remembering will be global in scope. The earth is our home and humankind is our family.

Myths have been around for much longer than you. Although you may make and extend stories, the ones that last have done so because they resonate and have meaning for many people, perhaps different meaning in subtle ways for each person. If you can explore the process of understanding in each person then your power and your stories can only grow.



### Notes from TED Talk by Andrew Stanton

Why tell a story? deepens who we are as human beings. gives our lives purpose. connection to others.

Belief
- "there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love if you heard their story"

Tips

- Make me care
- Make it inevitable but not predictable
- Give character a spine (decision making core) (wall-e: find the beauty; marlin: prevent harm to nemo; ...)
- The audience wants to work for their meal (2+2).
- Stories aren't exact or predictable
- All well drawn characters have a dominant unconscious goal. Acknowledge what drives you take the wheel and steer it
- Change must happen in a story (Static stories die. Life is never static.)
- "Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty" -William Archer
  - make me want to know what will happen next
  - make me want to know how it will conclude in the long term
  - create honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt about the outcome
- Singular goal
- Truth that deepens understanding of who we are
- Stories have guidelines, but not rules
- Like your main character
- Theme: "who are you?"
- Invoke a sense of wonder
- Capture truth from your life

### Neurotransmitters - Note from TED Talk by David JP Philips
- Dopamine - suspense, cliff hanger, storytelling in general
- Oxytocin - empathy, feel human (generosity, trust, bonding)
- Endorphin - laughter >> creative, relaxed, focused

- Cortisol && Adrenalin - scare >> intolerant, irritable, uncreative, critical, memory impaired, bad decisions

"YOU pick the story you want, to release the hormone you wish, in the person you're talking to, to get the desired effects that you want."


## Important Storytelling Frameworks

### The Hero's Journey (Monomyth)
_"A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man" -Joseph Campbell_

"Heroism, after all, is contagious."

High Level
1. Departure - receives a call to adventure, is reluctant, but is helped by a mentor
2. Initiation - traverses the threshold into the unknown, faces trials, overcomes the main obstacles/enemy, gains reward
3. Return - traverses back to the ordinary world with treasure for benefit of fellow man (hero is transformed by adventure and has power over both worlds)

In Depth (Campbell)

1. Departure

    1. Call to adventure - the hero, living in normality, receives information to head off into the unknown
    2. Refusal of the call - often the hero initially refuses the call (possibly from duty, fear, insecurity, ...)
    3. Meeting the Mentor (Supernatural aid) - guide appears (often supernatural) and frequently gives hero artifacts for his/her quest
    4. Crossing the threshold - hero leaves own world and ventures into dangerous realm with unknown rules and limits
    5. Belly of the whale - the final separation from the hero's known world and self, showing a willingness to undergo metamorphosis (and initially encountering a minor danger) ("The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died.")

2. Initiation

    6. The road of trials - a series of tests for the hero to overcome (usually in sets of 3; hero often fails one or more tests)
    7. The meeting with the goddess
    8. Woman as temptress
    9. Atonement with the father
    10. Apotheosis
    11. The ultimate boon

3. Return

    12. Refusal of the return
    13. The magic flight
    14. Rescue from without
    15. The crossing of the return threshold
    16. Master of two worlds
    17. Freedom to live

5. FIND - Get what they wanted (Meeting with the Goddess)
6. TAKE - Pay a heavy price for it (Meet your Maker)
7. RETURN - Then return to their familiar situation (Bringing it Home) "It's not a journey if you never come back"
8. CHANGE - Having changed (Master of Both Worlds)

Goes for characters, tone, theme


### The Pitch
(See my pitch deck post for more details)

- The Shift
  - Start with a big, undeniable change that creates stakes. No matter what you’re selling, your most formidable obstacle is prospects’ adherence to the status quo. Your primary adversary, in other words, is a voice inside people’s heads that goes, We’ve gotten along just fine without it, and we’ll always be fine without it.
  - Demonstrate the world has changed in a fundamental way that (1) is undeniable, (2) is happening independently of your company, and (3) gives rise to stakes
- The Enemy
  - Name the enemy. What is stopping the aspiring heroes (marketers? salespeople? your target audience) from reaching their goal?
  - Naming a common enemy will put you and the investors on the same side psychologically
  - (Prove pain exists, Show who has the pain, Use a relatable story)
- The Promised Land
  - Show the future that is possible thanks to having your product
  - This should be both (a) desirable (obviously) and (b) difficult for prospects to reach without you
- The Magic Wand
  - Imagine if... (instead of having to do X, you could do Y)
  - Introduce your product and its unique value proposition through the lens of the benefit to the hero (new capability, easier behavior, etc.)
  - Use pictures to show this benefit
- Proof that the Magic Wand will get people to the Promised Land
  - Testimonials, stats


## Meaning
Meaning for event is based on how you see it playing into the overall story.

Positive storytelling skills are great for life.

An event's meaning is unknown in that moment; it's based on perception of what's to come. Hearing someone say "uh oh" when playing with Legos will have a very different meaning for the same event than if they context is they're performing surgery. The sound waves hitting our eardrum may be the exact same, but our interpretation can differ drastically based on perceived threat or other context. See sound meditation.

An event's meaning is clearer in hindsight, but the meaning again depends on what story is being told. From a personal perspective you can see how a moment led to a turning point in a relationship or career, and it can be more obvious. Other events are more subject to interpretation, and it's crucial to be able to tell stories to ourselves and others that give meaning to arbitrary events in our lives.

Gratefulness ascribes positive meaning to past and current events. It's an element of positive self storytelling.
