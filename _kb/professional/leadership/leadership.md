title: Leadership
---

## Definition
Leaders have followers. A leader is an equal whom you decide to follow on your own free will and can stop following at any time. Consequently, leadership stems from social influence, not authority or power.

People follow leaders because they make people feel
- Significant
- Supported / Protected
- Excited about their work
- That they are growing
- That they are part of a community
- That they are creating a better future

In short, "Leadership is a process of social influence which maximizes the efforts of others toward the achievement of a greater good." But more than that, it is about creating feeling. And being aware of emotions, identifying causes, altering emotions, and making people feel certain ways are all skills characteristic of someone with high emotional intelligence.

Leadership vs. Management:
Management is ensuring the work specified is done well. Leadership is asking/deciding whether the work should be done at all.

## Stories of a Leader
- Story of self = Story of why you are who you are - the way you're wired and why you have certain weaknesses too (needs to be vulnerable)
- Story of us = Why this team? How it impacts the greater team?
- Story of now = Why this time?

Bonus points when followers can give these same stories to new followers.

Leaders should know who the evangelists are, how they communicate it, and how the stories diverge and converge.
