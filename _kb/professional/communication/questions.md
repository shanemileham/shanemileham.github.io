Know the right questions to ask is often the most important thing you can do.

How to ask the right questions?

- Understand relations between things
- Understand reasons (history)
- Understand causality (effects)

- Both close-ended and open-ended questions can be useful
- Ask the logical converse of a question (e.g. What will make this succeed >> What will make this fail)

5 Whys = Ask why 5 times repeatedly, each time going deeper
