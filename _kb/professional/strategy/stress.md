## Stress Definition
Anything which applies pressure to an entity (person, system, organization).


## Stress Axioms
- In small quantities, stress has little effect on the entity
- In excess, stress can break an entity in some way
- In certain ranges of stress, antifragile entities become stronger
  - Antifragile = the component pieces of the system are fragile, and this allows the overall system to adapt and be antifragile (note that antifragile pieces lead to a fragile system)
  - This includes most physiological and psychological systems, and many societal systems (such as evolution)
  - See the book Antifragile for more info :)
- Weakness/Inefficiencies will persist in a system unless there is stress
- If you want to strengthen an antifragile system, apply stress


## How Stress Adaptation Works

### Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome

Phases
1. Alarm - When a stressor is perceived, the system typically reacts (the human body responds with a "fight-or-flight" reaction)
2. Resistance - At this stage the entity continues to fight the stressor
3. Exhaustion - If the stressor continues past the entity's ability to resist, the entity becomes exhausted and breaks

### Stress Adaptation Components

- Stressor is applied
- The entity/organism breaks
- Stressor is removed in a timely manner (before exhaustion)
- Entity adapts


### Stress Cycling

(Supercompensation = adaptation)


## How to apply stress effectively

- Know the minimum amount of stress required to affect the system (and trigger adaptation)
- Know the maximal amount of stress that will break the system
- Apply stress in this optimal stress zone
- As the entity resists and nears exhaustion, remove the stressor
- Let the entity recover
- When the entity is fully recovered, repeat


## Notes
- Stress in humans is holistic and combines (psychologically, physically, ...)
- Consistency is overrated >> doesn't lead to growth
- Sleep according to stress (recovery depending on stress)
- Learn how to recover quickly first, then how to stress >> faster growth
