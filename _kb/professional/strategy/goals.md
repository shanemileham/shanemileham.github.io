SMART goals

OKRs

Instead of/in addition to setting goals, you can also set anti-goals: the things you want to avoid

Accept that you're far from perfect. Then get visible. Perfectionists don't want to mess up. First understand that you've already messed up. Now just make it better. Like my KB. it's a bunch of half written notes scattered and picked up when I have interest. All pull. Far from perfect but fun.

Pull vs push >> be pulled towards your goals (long term solution)
