Learnings:
- Assets are linear. Avoid.
- Resources = finances, network, time.
- Knowledge is exponential. Pursue. Low attrition; do first.
- Network is exponential. Pursue. Higher attrition though; do later.
- When stressed (resources / under attack), doing linear trades is required. Only do this at the last minute. Buffer depends on risk tolerance.
