Learnings:
- Assets are linear. Avoid.
- Resources = finances, network, time.
- Knowledge is exponential. Pursue. Low attrition; do first.
- Network is exponential. Pursue. Higher attrition though; do later.
- When stressed (resources / under attack), doing linear trades is required. Only do this at the last minute. Buffer depends on risk tolerance.

Beginning game is hustle. Mid-game is principles. And mid-to-late game is throwing principles away and going by situation. End game is psychological because it's political and play against opponents when both people know everything so far.

Intuition in business or martial arts when you're going too fast.
