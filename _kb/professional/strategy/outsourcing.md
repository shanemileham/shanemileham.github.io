## Why
- Save time and money!
- Only do what you love doing

## Identify Tasks to Outsource
All tasks to be outsourced are things where your time would be better spent elsewhere.

1. Start a list for tasks you can outsource.
1. Ask yourself these questions:
  - What do I not like doing?
  - What am I not good at doing (and don't care to get better at)?
  - What have I been putting off for a while?
  - What 20% of things cost me 80% of my time?
  - What 20% of things create 80% of my stress/anger/unhappiness?
  - What could a freelancer do for less than the value of my time?
1. Log everything you do for a few days. Review the above questions on this log.
1. Look over your list and think about crossing out any task which:
  - Doesn't actually need to be done (Don't do these yourself)
  - Doesn't have a better use of my time
  - Is vitally important (and you'd rather do it personally)
  - You can do better or good enough for the project
  - Would be too expensive to outsource
  - Would cause you undue stress/cost if it was not completed well or on time by a freelancer

  - Timelines/Milestones/Deadlines
  - Quality metrics
  - Costs
  - Other KPIs
- Communication expectations

### Posting Job
1. Choose one or more platforms to post on
1. Define your value proposition for the freelancer. They value:
  - Money from the job
  - Repeat gigs (they spend a lot of time trying to land gigs)
  - Quick/Immediate job win (usually they wait days/weeks to win a project)
  - Rating, review, and your project in their portfolio (helps them get future gigs)
  - Treatment - Treat them respectfully, fairly, and with appreciation for their work
  - Work they like or can be proud of (they will do this for less than work they don't). Be fun and allow your freelancers to be creative.
1. Write up a title and summary
  - Make your task clear - Be specific, use comparisons to similar tasks/projects, clarify context or industry
  - Make your value proposition clear - Money, Repeat Work, NOW/URGENT, 5-Star Feedback, etc.
  - If this is not a fixed-price job, request quotes


### Choosing Candidates
1. Wait for more applications to come in before hiring (~24hrs)
1. Choose top candidates from application pool by looking at:
  - Speed - Speed of response
  - Effort - Specificity of response
  - Skills - How well their profile/portfolio matches the task
  - Credibility - Reviews and previous success rate
1. Ask candidates:
  - To repeat back to you in their own words (works well on the phone)
  - How they would tackle the problem/process and hourly breakdown
  - What will make this project successful
  - To show examples of relevant past work
1. (Optional) Test Multiple Candidates
  - Ask the candidate if they would be willing to do a "paid test project"
  - Create a small test project
  - Give the project to each of the candidates
  - Evaluate candidates' communication, understanding, work, and speed
1. (Optional) Repost the job - Useful if no candidates passed or you want a larger pool to choose from (80% of applicants will come in first 12 hours)
1. Choose the candidate(s) you'd want to work with


### Negotiation
- Engage your freelancer before discussing price
- Don't name the price first
- Do your research and know the market estimate
- Reiterate your value proposition (and be likeable)
- Have the candidates compete by bidding
- Listen more
- Don't low ball them


## Managing Freelancers
- Communicate with them
- Ask them for feedback - You will get great insights on what will make their job easier and you will discover the major roadblocks in their way. Freelancers feel more connected with you as a result.
- Motivate them
  - Mastery - Make sure they have everything they need to succeed and be proud of their work
  - Autonomy - Give them more responsibility and trust
  - Purpose - Thank them, appreciate their work, and explain how much they have helped you
- Ask for revisions or improvements, and give detailed constructive feedback
