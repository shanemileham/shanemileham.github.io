title: Hiring Security
---

Security people are difficult to hire

Skills to look for
- Know how to handle things they've never seen before
- They can get buy in from people (since people are the dangerous security risk, people need to understand and follow protocols)

Note that
- Security people are finicky and know their worth. Make sure (like any employee) they're treated well and are working on meaningful work for a reasonable salary.

Ask questions about
- Hypothetical situations
- Worst case
- How they'd handle worst case (repeat)
