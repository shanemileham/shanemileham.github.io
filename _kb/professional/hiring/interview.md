## Notes
Interview are great ways to get to know people and connect as human beings. Separately, they are great for evaluation. Regardless of how a person does, you can still have a wonderful conversation with them.

Remember that a "hell yes" candidate can have a huge impact, much more than a regular "yes" candidate, so make sure you emphatically back the person or let them know otherwise and why.
