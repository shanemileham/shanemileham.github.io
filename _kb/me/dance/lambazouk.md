Step counts
Zouk/lamba steps have 123567 but really this is nomenclature to refer to the first second third fourth fifth and sixth steps in the progression. Just using chick chick tum loses the information of which step you're on. Once you name the steps, you can place them anywhere on the best. Usually the 3 is back, but it can be the 7 or the 1 or 5 (or others possibly).

Moves
Front and back. Lateral. Can do either of these while also turning clockwise or counterclockwise.
Transition between them. Front and back to lateral on step back because the open is easier. Lateral to front back is after passing her to the left because you can collect her and keep her pendulum motion.

Move names are based on her steps. Lead can stay in place.

Frame
Right shoulder back. Left hand out. Lead with the frame.

Leading
Location and disequilibrium. Can lead with both. Location is centered around a midpoint and is essentially disequilibrium around this point. Disequilibrium is for her body. It's not enough to cue a turn or momentum. You must make her body or frame in disequilibrium so that her return to equilibrium accomplishes what you intended to ask. Overall you have disequilibrium between the two of you and disequilibrium of her frame to lead motion.
