Drills
- Footwork timing
- Footwork redirect all directions
- Contrabody ABCD in place
- Contrabody ABCD with steps
- Chunking the basic pattern


Grounding hip flexor push
Lateral connect back, use resistance band between hands
Push down with flat hands for grounding and up
Balance something on head while doing this

Belly to belly walking keeping connection


Private Lesson and Workshop Notes

## Alina
Know where my follow is in space, where she's turning, give her grounding from above, place myself where I need to catch her if she's turning


## Jaime and Kiri
Femur hip bones
Knees back impulse
Bling
Three lines
Head turn from pec
Each body part and its use
Breathe through pulse

My world
Violence of animalistic

Have expression
Head movement resolved in hips

GIVE music to her

## Ashley Kent
Lateral from body not frame with extended steps especially forward

Connection more with hips. Don't force it, but instead don't close chest so she can connect on step in

<See video recap>

Hugs - start from the legs. They're grounded to have their energy.

Keep her on axis
Any force to push her off axis will be resisted
Instead any pressure should be directed downwards almost in line with her axis

To lead a joint merely press
To lead a muscle, you must first be beneath the skin of it to give signal
To move hands and follow the body, slide softly against the skin

Keep elbows out to have connection with arms and be able to give connection signals
Let hands move with her body
Use wrists gently

The hands create the shape of the body to come, or the next motion
You slide pressure to signal the next shape - where your hand/arm has left she fills that space, and where you move to, she adapts and shies away from to create even connection (conforms like water)

Can create turns with a turn of the follows wrist
Can lateral by turning their arms in to create a better frame if needed



## 201810XX
From workshop with Bruno:
- frame with extension and compression.
- light touch for elongation, firm for resistance and counterbalancing

Feet
I'm doing a lot of arms. Keep frame and start from center
Hips more forward
First step on ball of foot is old technique. Now flat. So only the ends of the pendulum are ball.

Lateral
Ball of foot push off same
No arms, all from motion of check
Hips in neutral the whole time
Don't over cross. Connect chest direction to hips and foot.
Lateral back to basic. Simple version. Catch shoulder, then create rubber band on the quick quick. She comes in on the slow.
Tension is on the quick quick for lateral, NOT the slow.

Lunge
Turn. Rise on toe, split, toe heel knee bend. Keep hips straight, draw arc with chest facing forward.

Lunge turn
Hand slightly raise, then don't use arm. Turn comes from me sliding to the right. Don't rush to lower arm.
Then rock step forward as noted before. Get rubber band effect.

Three options out of lunge:
1. Closed basic with hand across stomach
2. Open basic (likely to go into elastico/vomite)
3. Lateral. No right hand connection.

Timing on feet for lunge is quick and quick, not quick quick.

Lateral to lunge is restep on the right (facing the new direction) followed by quick and quick.
