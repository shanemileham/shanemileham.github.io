Private Lesson and Workshop Notes

## Alina
Know where my follow is in space, where she's turning, give her grounding from above, place myself where I need to catch her if she's turning


## Jaime and Kiri
Femur hip bones
Knees back impulse
Bling
Three lines
Head turn from pec
Each body part and its use
Breathe through pulse

My world
Violence of animalistic

Have expression
Head movement resolved in hips

GIVE music to her

## Ashley Kent
Lateral from body not frame with extended steps especially forward

Connection more with hips. Don't force it, but instead don't close chest so she can connect on step in

<See video recap>


## China Soulzouk

Hugs - start from the legs. They're grounded to have their energy.

Keep her on axis
Any force to push her off axis will be resisted
Instead any pressure should be directed downwards almost in line with her axis

To lead a joint merely press
To lead a muscle, you must first be beneath the skin of it to give signal
To move hands and follow the body, slide softly against the skin

Keep elbows out to have connection with arms and be able to give connection signals
Let hands move with her body
Use wrists gently

The hands create the shape of the body to come, or the next motion
You slide pressure to signal the next shape - where your hand/arm has left she fills that space, and where you move to, she adapts and shies away from to create even connection (conforms like water)

Can create turns with a turn of the follows wrist
Can lateral by turning their arms in to create a better frame if needed



## 201810XX
frame with extension and compression.
light touch for elongation, firm for resistance and counterbalancing
