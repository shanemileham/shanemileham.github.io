Tango

Connection exercises. Steps on ground. Forward side back directions. Connection through chest. Basic step pattern.

General notes
Challenge myself and take further steps. See where and how things break.
When I move left, I tend to close my right shoulder. Always always face my partner like this.
During pliea (sp?) Left tibialis posterior got tired.

Codes
Make eye contact and ask to dance silently from across the room. She will respond accordingly. Then walk around the circulation of the room until you get to her.
Do not touch her to ask or verbally ask. This will get you an automatic no. Might've been another guy next to you who got the yes - guys take that risk. A woman's value in the market economy of the milenga is by how she dances. So she wants to make sure her first or second is with someone good so she can show how good she is. It's important because you commit to dancing four tangos in a row with someone. You want to watch them closely first to see if you could do four dances with them.

Dance tips
Walk with intention. It's a walk forward to forget the troubles of the world behind you. Very improvisational. Can step on any beat. Forward, side and regret/repent, half turn with pivot thing.
