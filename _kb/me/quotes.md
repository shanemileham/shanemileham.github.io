‎"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."
-Coach Carter

Marcus Aurelius - Meditations:
“Your mind will be like its habitual thoughts; for the soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts. Soak it then in such trains of thoughts as, for example: Where life is possible at all, a right life is possible.”
“Your time has a limit set to it. Use it, then, to advance your enlightenment; or it will be gone, and never in your power again.”
“To live each day as though one’s last, never flustered, never apathetic, never attitudinizing—here is the perfection of character.”
“Take it that you have died today, and your life’s story is ended; and henceforward regard what future time may be given you as an uncovenanted surplus, and live it out in harmony with nature.”
“Never confuse yourself by visions of an entire lifetime at once... remember that it is not the weight of the future or the past that is pressing upon you, but ever that of the present alone.”
“The approval of such men, who do not even stand well in their own eyes, has no value for him.”
“The whole universe is change, and life itself is but what you deem it.”
“So here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not, ‘This is a misfortune,’ but ‘To bear this worthily is a good fortune.’”
“Men seek for seclusion in the wilderness, by the seashore, or in the mountains - a dream you have cherished too fondly yourself. But such fancies are wholly unworthy of a philosopher, since at any moment you choose you can retire within yourself. Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul; above all, he possesses resources in himself, which he need only contemplate to secure immediate ease of mind - the ease that is but another word for a well-ordered spirit. Avail yourself often, then, of this retirement and so continually renew yourself.”
“Cultivate these, then, for they are wholly within your power: sincerity and dignity; industriousness, and sobriety. Avoid grumbling, be frugal, considerate, and frank; be temperate in manner and speech; carry yourself with authority.”
“How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.”
“Habitual recurrence to the harmony will increase your mastery of it.”
“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your own estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.”
“Take me and cast me where you will; I shall still be possessor of the divinity within me, serene and content.”

“If anything is worth doing, do it with all your heart.” - Buddha

Peace in my heart. Peace in my soul. Wherever I’m going, I’m already home.
