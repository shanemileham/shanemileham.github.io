Vocabulary

Words I don't use:
- Should
- Can’t/never/etc unless literal
- Good/Bad - Good and Bad are merely shorthand terms for describing the relationship between a thing and a goal, whether it increases or decreases the likelihood of achieving or contributing to that goal
- Need - really just an exaggerated want, unless it’s talking about something that is literally impossible to accomplish unless you have X; then X is a need.
- Natural - what does this even mean? A high probability without external influence? Not a useful word for sure; much less a positive one.
- Healthy - a synonym for good in relation to goals for health, but since these are specific to individuals...
- Hard - means a large sum of time and effort
- Replace the phrase “I have to” with “I get to”
