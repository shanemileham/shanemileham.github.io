Goal: have a fully functional set of things that fit in a backpack and carry-on

My list includes:

- Travel Adapter ([Zendure Passport](https://zendure.com/products/passport-global-travel-adapter-with-auto-resetting-fuse-black))
- [Bose QC35 Headphones](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html)
- Bluetooth speaker ([Anker Soundcore 2](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-Exclusive-Water-Resistant/dp/B01MTB55WH/))
- Google home mini
- Backpack
- Duffel Bag
  - _I prefer this to luggage because it requires no hands, fits as a carry on, and is much easier for stairs_
- Packing cubes

I've also been suggested to get:
- Penny board / [Boosted mini](https://buy.boostedboards.com/boards/boosted-mini)
- [Noise cancelling earbuds](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earphones/quietcomfort-20i-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones.html) for sleeping

Software

I'll update this list with more things later
