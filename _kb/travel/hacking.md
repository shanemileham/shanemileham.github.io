RTW ticket? Star alliance and one world
Outsource RTW research to VA
"RTW" With airtreks
Simply put: Use Airtreks or another similar agent, like STA Travel (statravel.com) or Flight Centre (flightcentre.com), instead of booking directly with the airline.
Likely avoid RTW

Priceline. Hotwire. Better bidding

If you are going to bid, I also recommend the website Better Bidding (betterbidding.com).
You can book hostels via the two largest booking sites: Hostelworld (hostelworld.com) and Hostelbookers (hostelbookers.com). I prefer Hostelworld, as they have a larger inventory of hostels and a better booking interface.
Eatwith (eatwith.com) lets locals post listings for dinner parties and specialty meals that people can sign up for. There is a fee (each host sets his or her own price), and you can pick from a variety of cuisines (depending on what the host wants to cook). EatWithaLOCAL (eatwithalocal.socialgo.com), Meal Sharing (mealsharing.com), and COlunching (colunching.com) are similar networks worth investigating. The Ghetto Gourmet (theghet.com) is an older version in which locals organize free dinner parties. It’s not as widespread, but it’s the free option.
More important, be sure to ask, “Where do you eat?” not “Where should I eat?”
