scrum agile - read this before you hurt yourself

thought experiment

if you had to carry every sales call into the next sales call (if the next person would hear every previous sales call) >> you'd be more careful on every sales call (same with emails)

Even worse because working with
Every person had every previous email in their memory when you hit send
Even if you forget, your computer will whack you saying you missed something from months ago. Good luck finding it.

every sales call you, your team, or anyone has ever left or promise they've made, you're responsible for

Your first sales call, you have to think about your next 5000 sales calls

Directly related to bugs

even with aggressive goals, keep thinking and having empathy
