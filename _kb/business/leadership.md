## Definition
Leaders have followers. A leader is an equal whom you decide to follow on your own free will and can stop following at any time. Consequently, leadership stems from social influence, not authority or power.

People follow leaders because they make people feel
- Significant
- Supported / Protected
- Excited about their work
- That they are growing
- That they are part of a community
- That they are creating a better future

In short, "Leadership is a process of social influence which maximizes the efforts of others toward the achievement of a greater good."

Leadership vs. Management:
Management is ensuring the work specified is done well. Leadership is asking/deciding whether the work should be done at all.
