How to change narratives

How do you get someone to see it from your side?
- Have people get in a room and argue the other person's side
- When there's no desire for the other person to see it from your side, be kind and make them feel heard (while also not accepting any incorrect parts of the narrative)


## Sync vs Async
Sync = can answer questions and go back and forth
Async = great for assignments and one way comm

## Email Writing
- Emotion - what does the other person want/need? What is their current narrative?
