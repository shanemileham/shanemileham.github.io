- “If you address a market that really wants your product — if the dogs are eating the dog food — then you can screw up almost everything in the company and you will succeed”
- Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.
- Product/market fit is when people sell for you
- Look at this curve, ‘percent monthly active’ versus ‘number of days from acquisition’, if you end up with a retention curve that is asymptotic to a line parallel to the X-axis, you have a viable business and you have product market fit for some subset of market.

## Metrics

- Low Churn
