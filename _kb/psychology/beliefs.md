Tony Robbins Exercise:
1. "What has each belief cost you in the past, and what has it cost people you've loved in the past? What have you lost because of this belief? See it, hear it, feel it."
2.  "What is each costing you and people you care about in the present? See it, hear it, feel it."
3. "What will each cost you and people you care about one, three, five, and 10 years from now? See it, hear it, feel it."

"When we feel pain in one time zone — meaning past, present, or future — we just switch to another time zone rather than change, because change brings so much uncertainty and so much instability and so much fear to people," Robbins said. The exercise prevents you from escaping yourself.
