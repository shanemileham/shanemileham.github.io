title: Confidence
---

## Definition
> a state of being certain either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effective (Wikipedia)


## Importance
Highly related to the cyclical nature of belief updating (belief -> action -> experience -> belief -> ...) because confidence is belief-based. The self-fulfilling effects of confidence can be seen from teaching (e.g. Pygmalion Effect) to attraction to sports.


## Altering Confidence
Choose if you want your confidence level to be accurate to the world, or if you're okay with being overconfident (which can be helpful in many cases).

Confidence usually consists of certain beliefs:
- I am certain about an aspect of the future (usually because)
  - It can happen (hope) and
  - I have the skills/plan/attitude to make it happen ([Self-efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy))


### Increasing Confidence
- Identify thing you want to be confident about (future prediction / hypothesis)
- Increase confidence in the prediction
  - Realistically (if you want an accurate level of confidence) or
  - Optimistically (if you are aiming for overconfidence)

Realistic adjustment
- [Goal setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting)
- [Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_visualization)

Optimistic adjustment
- Memory recall and preperformance routines - These flood the mind with recent experiences (recalled and performed respectively)
- [Self-Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue#Positive_self-talk)

Projecting Confidence
- Body language
- Vocabulary
  - Be precise in your predictions
  - Avoid uncertain vocabulary ([Study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/ulterior-motives/201805/confidence-and-certainty-advisors))


### Decreasing Confidence
Note that decreased confidence can be very important from a business perspective - having an accurate assessment of risk is paramount to effectively derisking the future. See /kb/business/management for more.

- Ask
  - What could go wrong?
  - What risks exist here?
  - What's the worst case scenario?
- Raise expectations
- Compare to others
