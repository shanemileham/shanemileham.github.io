## What emotions are and why they're useful
TODO (synthesize Input below)

There are no "good" and "bad" emotions - just emotions we desire to experience, and ones we don't. Typically the ones we desire to experience are the ones we feel when everything is already going well.

Emotions rise and fall
This too shall pass. Everything will get better and get worse.

Nothing to be ashamed of


## Input
What to do with different emotions; examples:
- Discomfort shows you that you need to pay attention right now to what is happening because you're being given the opportunity to change, to do something differently than you typically do it.
- Anger shows you what you're passionate about, where your boundaries are, and what you believe needs to change about the world.
- Disappointment shows you that you tried for something, that you did not give in to apathy, and that you still care.
- Guilt shows you that you're still living life in other people's expectations of what you should do.
- Shame shows you that you're internalizing other people's beliefs about who you should be (or who you are) and that you need to reconnect with yourself.

## Input

Emotions are signals sent by our subconscious mind that motivate us to perform an action which either helps us to attain a reward or makes us avoid something that can potentially harm our well-being.

Simply put, our subconscious mind communicates with us using the language of emotions so that we may be able to seek pleasure, avoid pain and maintain our well-being.



Nothing is positive or negative in and of itself. We call something 'positive' if it benefits us and 'negative' because it harms us. Strictly speaking, there's no negative emotion because all emotions motivate us to do actions that lead to a potential gain, whether conscious or unconscious, perceived or real.



It's funny how people call fear a negative emotion when it prevents them from approaching strangers and consider it as something positive if it helps them run away from a chasing bear.



But why is it so?

Why do positive emotions feel good and negative ones feel bad?

Your subconscious mind is a sort of recording device that is continually watching your actions. If it believes that your current actions will contribute to your well-being than it will send you positive emotions so that you feel motivated to repeat what you're currently doing.

On the other hand, if it believes that what you're currently doing has the potential of harming your well-being, then it'll send you negative emotions so that you're motivated to discontinue doing what you're currently doing or change your actions.

For instance, if you're trying to lose weight, then you’ll feel good after you exercise because exercising is something that’s going to make you achieve your goal and your mind wants you to repeat the activity.

If, on the other hand, you eat unhealthy junk food, then you’ll feel bad because your mind is trying to tell you that “this is wrong, something you shouldn't be doing when you're trying to lose weight”. Your mind sends you bad feelings so that you do not repeat this activity.




How emotions are triggered

Our emotions are primarily triggered by our thoughts. These thoughts arise from our belief systems or from our interpretation of external events. Whenever an external event happens, we attach meaning to that event. It's this meaning that results in emotions.

This meaning that we attach to life events is partly innate and partly learned.

Now the problem is that this ‘attachment of meaning’ process is hardly a conscious process for a lot of people. That’s why most people believe that emotions appear out of nowhere and that they have no control over them.

They have little or no clue about how their emotional state changes simply because they don't have enough emotional awareness i.e. the ability to be aware of the situations and thoughts that trigger your emotions. It's a skill that can be developed through practice.

What happens + How we interpret it = Emotions

The reason why emotions appear to be automatic is that we may not be fully aware when they're being manufactured in the depths of our subconscious. We usually become aware after an emotion is triggered.

Our subconscious mind first gathers information from the environment, sorts out facts and then decides the suitable emotion that should be triggered in any given situation.

For example, suppose a person throws a chocolate wrapper on the ground instead of a rubbish bin and two other persons i.e. person A and person B watch him.

If A thinks that we should take care of our environment then most probably the feelings of anger and disgust will be generated in him. However, no such emotions may get triggered in B because he doesn't bother about the cleanliness of the environment.

It's all a game of beliefs, the thoughts that arise from those beliefs and consequently the way in which we interpret an incident. Some of these beliefs are genetically programmed into our psyche (e.g. fear of falling) while others are learned during our past life experiences (e.g. people can't be trusted).

Once you develop enough awareness, then you’ll be able to carefully observe the thoughts that cross your mind when you experience certain events and with practice, you’ll come to know exactly what causes your emotional state to change.

Emotions exist for a reason. They're trying to tell us something.
Every emotion exists for a reason. Each has something great it can be used for.

Emotion follows state. State can follow action. So you can change your emotions through action.
