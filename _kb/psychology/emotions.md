Emotions rise and fall

Nothing to be ashamed of


Feelings aren't first class citizens

We treat them like they are and if someone feels hurt they blame another person. That's not how it works. Ask any meditation master - feelings are ephemeral, sometimes counterfactually caused by another person, but always a result of suffering etc.
