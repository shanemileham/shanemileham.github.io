## Notes
- Time perception is relative to quickly accessed memories (spectrum)
- Compression of memories based on delta (like revisioning)
- Memories accessed are based on strength - high emotions, quantity of time (repetition), or sensory memory (large part of the spectrum. This is why days seem long but years seem short.
- To harness this power, we decide if we want to elongate or shorten our perception of the present
- Shorten our perception of pain - follow it with high delta strong emotional and sensory memories, making it move further back in the spectrum. If our concept of identity is based on those memories, moving a rough breakup or painful moment further back in the spectrum is what helps us get over it.
- For past pleasurable moments - we can recollect them and the repetition strengthens the memory and makes it take up more relative space in our memory spectrum
- For upcoming pain (race, etc.) - we can envision it quite vividly with all the senses, and that will make the delta very small, thus making the race seem shorter.
- For upcoming pleasure - we can practice mindfulness and sleep more in preparation so that we can fully experience with all senses heightened the experience
- In this way we can remember life how we choose and increase our performance and ability to handle difficult situations.
- If work is then painful, walking through the day at the beginning of the night before will make time seem to speed up during work (as well as less interruptions - see the kappa effect).
