## Introduction to Learning
### Model and Definitions
_Learning is a cyclical process in which a person is exposed to experiences (either direct or hypothetical) which modify the person's existing knowledge and expectations about the world._

(Insert cyclical picture of Beliefs <---> Experiences)

- BELIEFS → EXPERIENCES ----- Action/Thoughts - Instrumental Rationality
- EXPERIENCES → BELIEFS ----- Induction/Deduction - Epistemic Rationality

- **Belief** = A belief is a part of a person's mental model of the world. It reflects what a person thinks is true about the world, and consequently causes a person to anticipate certain experiences (at the cost of not anticipating an alternative experience). Beliefs are often metaphorically referred to as maps, and are considered valid to the extent that they correctly correspond to the truth. (Read more at [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/))
- **Experience** = The act or process of perceiving an event (this includes both direct encounters of reality as well as perceived situations in thought experiments).

The more an experience differs from a person's expectation, the more room there is to learn. However, isolating variables to minimize that difference can contribute to very effective learning. The following sections will explain how to learn from an experience and how to craft your experiences to maximize learning.

### Experience --> Belief (How to learn from an experience)
This section is about creating beliefs from experiences, and requires exceptional self-reflection. It will explain the necessary realms of formal logic, cognitive biases, and rational reasoning to enable you to learn as quickly and accurately as possible.

A few relevant definitions:
- **Epistemic Rationality** = the part of rationality which involves achieving accurate beliefs about the world. It involves updating on receiving new evidence, mitigating cognitive biases, and examining why you believe what you believe. ([LessWrong](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality#Epistemic_rationality))
- **Deductive Reasoning (top-down)**: the process of inferring particular instances from a general law (Google). The process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion. Deductive reasoning links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.
- **Abductive Reasoning**: TODO
- **Inductive Reasoning (bottom-up)**: the process of inferring a general law from particular instances (Google)


Note cognitive biases and logical fallacies here



### Belief --> Experience (How to craft experiences to maximize learning)
This is how to choose your experience to maximize your learning

Instrumental Rationality = Instrumental rationality is concerned with achieving goals. More specifically, instrumental rationality is the art of choosing and implementing actions that steer the future toward outcomes ranked higher in one's preferences. Said preferences are not limited to 'selfish' preferences or unshared values; they include anything one cares about. ([LessWrong](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality#Instrumental_rationality))

Craft your experiences in an order that will require the least experiences to the most learning (e.g. initial data set, chunking practice, sequential levels up, alternating with full set experiences - each of these are "tools" in your belt for choosing what you need to experience next to learn more quickly). Ideal order?

Design learning experiences: initial data seeding (ML), logical parsing, compression, synthesis (vars, entailments)


Example way to maximize learning: binary search game

Steps to Learn Anything:
- Design (Create experiences) - Obtain useful pieces of information through experiences
- Decide what specifically you want to learn
- Identify keywords related to the chosen topic
- Induction (Create beliefs) - Process information and find the patterns to create beliefs
- Deduction (Act on beliefs) - Iterate on your model by testing beliefs in hypothetical scenarios

Unordered (inexhaustive) list of learning-related hacks:
- Pomodoro
- Sleep
- Repetition / SR
- Teach another person
- Etc.

How to use this model:
1. Subject = Define the subject (contextual)
  - What is X? In what direction do I want to learn?
  - What is my goal?
2. Model = Create a model of the subject
  - What is X composed of? (Mutually exclusive and exhaustive)
  - How do I break down the goal?
3. Definition = Define the parts of the model
  - What are those parts?
  - What are the subgoals?
4. Question = Write the questions to the model
  - What questions do I need to be able to answer to understand X?
  - What do I need to do to accomplish the subgoal?
  - If you had 10min with an expert in X, what would you ask?
  - Who, What, When, Where, Why, Which, How → More info
  - Is, Does → Boolean
5. Answer = Practice answering the questions
  - What are the answers to those questions?
  - What are the answers to “What do I need to do to accomplish the subgoal?”?
6. Practice = Practice behaviors needed to be successful at the subject
  - How do I practice X?
  - How do I do the things necessary to accomplish the subgoal?

Talk to the person you know who is likely to know X best. Ask them who they know who knows X. Ask that person. Repeat through network connections until you are in contact with experts on X. Then ask them the questions listed in the “Steps to learn anything"

* Experience/Pattern --> causal expectation
* Order should be: dissect things correctly, chunk in incremental complexity until intuitive (basal ganglia)
* Endgame first (chess) - each step out adds one level of inference/complexity
* Expectation-Experience back and forth
  * Expectation to experience is created by your choices (which is created by your questions)
  * Experience to expectation/beliefs is modified by your cognitive biases. Here's (link) how to rationally form a model of the world.
- State affects accessing of beliefs - not covered in this
- Decisions also include evaluating alternatives for action in each case (https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_human-relations/s12-01-understanding-decision-making.html)
- Knowing, Habitualize, Intuitive (emotional)
- We can define learning as simply any change to the connections in our neuronal networks.
- An experience either meshes with existing information (intuitive) or doesn’t fit (counterintuitive). What to do in each state.
- Experience can include blueprints (someone else’s learning from their data)
- Practice, isolated drills,
- Superimpose your structure onto the optimal structure

  - Analysis
  - Traditions learning

Stages
- Problem identification
- What information will be needed?
- Where would I need to get that information?
- Data source decision
- Data gathering and validation (plus validation techniques) (logical parsing)
  - Knowing how to hack scientific journals
- Data structuring (dependencies etc)
- Memorization (traditional models)
- Use and behavior modifications (belief updates and habits)


## How to take notes
Note - basically highlights
Compress - discard highlights that are redundant or better explained with other highlights
Synthesize - understand the relation between the concepts and restructuring as if you're about to teach it. if concept B depends on concept A, concept A must come before concept B. Feel free to use any helpful visualizations/charts/diagrams during this stage.

## Other input
Process learners are better than learners who say “I’m smart” vs hard work

Focus on endgame, then midgame

MY NOTES ON LEARNING
Three types
Definitions (=) / Properties
Associations (between truth statements)
Problem solving (given a KB)
Example of a bad sentence
For the aerobic athlete, caffeine is thought to prolong aerobic endurance exercise. The mechanisms that have been proposed to cause this effect involve an increase in fat oxidation through the mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue or intramuscular fat stores

Belief experience
Belief updating
Preprocessing
Logic

Note a difference between skill acquisition and knowledge acquisition

Coursera Learning How To Learn / Mind for Numbers

I was never much interested in speed reading - anyone can read a lot of books, but the truly intelligent can do a lot with limited information. I found that studying rationality and logic actually sped up my comprehension tremendously. As I read, I only pay attention to phrases that differ from my previous understanding of the world (i.e. beliefs). Phrases such as “X may contribute to Y" are meaningless. “X leads to Y” is meaningless without a percentage and a linked study. “X causes Y” is important and requires evidence. “X is Y” is vitally important, but is equally important to criticize to make sure you’re getting the correct definition. All other logical relationships “X is a subset/superset of Y” are useful too because you can apply information from one to the other.

As a whole, reading for information consists of imparting anticipatory beliefs upon the reader with the corresponding evidence (see http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/). Anything less than that is not enough to alter beliefs and is therefore not “useful”.

So when reading, I only look for definitions and logical relationships and probability relationships (and maybe a few others I’m forgetting). Everything else is fluff.


Do I need this information?
How does this information fit together in a visual model?
What is the smallest amount of information (Premises) I need to create the model?
Do I know any similar information that can help me understand the model?
How does this model flow in a logical form from the premises?
Practice recreating the model (Decompression)

KB beeiefs to actions. If you want actions, change beliefs. Belief update systems?
Belief update TR
Also beliefs follow Experiences
Also habits help create experiences which will reinforce beliefs

Understand andbagree with belief theoretically then reinforce with experience

Inner/outer game/learning - Actions < Habits < Beliefs

Helps to have existing models to be able to reference to input information more easily (this is likely why people have preferred learning styles because they have better models for these things)

- think about something before reading about it. "It is dangerous to read about a subject before we have thought about it ourselves.... When we read, another person thinks for us; we merely repeat his mental process.... So it comes about that if anyone spends almost the whole day in reading,... he gradually loses the capacity for thinking" - Schopenhauer! It’s from this great book called story of Philosophy, definitely recommend giving it a read, although it exclusively focuses on Western philosophers ~ https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31795.The_Story_of_Philosophy
- You only prove things through direct experience. And that experience disproves any axioms that say that experience is impossible. The rest of science deals with probabilities and correlation and causation

- You learn most from what you teach others, and close from what you do (add learning pyramid by William Glasser)
  - 5% of what they learn when they’ve learned from a lecture.
  - 10% of what they learn when they’ve learned from reading.
  - 20% of what they learn from audio-visual.
  - 30% of what they learn when they see a demonstration.
  - 50% of what they learn when engaged in a group discussion.
  - 75% of what they learn when they practice what they learned.
  - 90% of what they learn when they teach someone else to use the information immediately.

- Beginner's mind - attitude of openness, eagerness, vulnerability, humility, curiosity, embracing fear. Don't assume you're an expert.
- Deliberate Learning - Systematic approach; start with end in mind.
- Know what not to learn.
- Don't multi-task

- Mapping existing mental models - connect what you're learning with something you already know about
