## What Happens (General Adaptation Syndrome)

Stress can be positive (eustress) or negative (distress) based on a person's coping ability and response.

A person who experiences eustress can become extremely resilient, strong, and improve their immune system. A person who experiences distress can experience serious health decline and depression. So it's important to know how to handle stress.






## How to manage stress

Reminder of definition: "Stress occurs when a person perceives they have insufficient resources (coping ability) to handle a perceived dangerous stressor (or set of stressors)."

Stress can therefore be managed by
- Perceive the stressor as non-dangerous (positive or irrelevant)
- Perceive resources as sufficient
- Gain more resources
- Remove the stressor(s)

### Perceive the stressor as non-dangerous

"stress may not be a stressor if the person does not perceive the stressor as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging"

Believe the stressor is
- Irrelevant
  - This stressor can't cause me harm
  - This stressor really isn't that harmful
- Challenging
  - This stressor has a purpose in my life
  - This stressor is part of a bigger story
  - This stressor is an opportunity
  - This stressor will make me better
  - I chose this stressor

Tasks
- Set the event into a broader perspective in which it does not seem so threatening
- Tim Ferris' fear exercise
- See what advantage lies in the challenge, what opportunity for growth

### Perceive resources as sufficient


- Time management
- Planning and decision making



FYI the typical definition of "Hardiness" includes the beliefs of
- Commitment (a tendency to involve oneself in activities in life and as having a genuine interest in and curiosity about the surrounding world (activities, things, other people))
- Control (a tendency to believe and act as if one can influence the events taking place around oneself through oneâ€™s own efforts)
- Challenge (the belief that change, rather than stability, is the normal mode of life and constitutes motivating opportunities for personal growth rather than threats to security)


### Gain more resources

- Improve coping ability
  - Learn necessary skills to remove the stressors (planning, time management, conflict resolution, ...)
