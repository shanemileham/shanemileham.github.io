## What Happens (General Adaptation Syndrome)

Stress can be positive (eustress) or negative (distress) based on a person's coping ability and response.

A person who experiences eustress can become extremely resilient, strong, and improve their immune system. A person who experiences distress can experience serious health decline and depression. So it's important to know how to handle stress.
