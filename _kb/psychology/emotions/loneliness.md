From Wikipedia:
- "the unpleasant experience that occurs when a person's network of social relations is deficient in some important way"
- "the physical absence of meaningful people around a person."
- "discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction"
- "Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely"
- "If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation"
