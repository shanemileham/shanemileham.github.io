If you rename "challenge" and "skill" to "stress" and "recovery" it matches well with Selye's [General Adaptation Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)#General_adaptation_syndrome).

Make sure to recover and then increase the challenge in your life.

Usually apathy is an undesirable state, so to alter:
1. Recover (see /kb/psychology/recovery)
2. Challenge
