title: Burnout
---

## Definition
Burnout = exhaustion and fatigue
Procrastination is just not feeling the energy to do something

## Cause
Six risk factors for work-related burnout:
- Mismatch in workload
- Mismatch in control
- Lack of appropriate awards
- Loss of a sense of positive connection with others in the workplace
- Perceived lack of fairness
- Conflict between values

## Recovery
(see recovery post)

Let it consume you for a day. Be a consumer. Plan for next day. Next day alarm goes off and workout and eat a good meal.

If you rename "challenge" and "skill" to "stress" and "recovery" it matches well with Selye's [General Adaptation Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)#General_adaptation_syndrome).
