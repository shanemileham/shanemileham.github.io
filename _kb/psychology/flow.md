## Definition

> Flow is described as: “the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.” Anyone who has programmed for long enough will recognize this state as incredibly productive and satisfying.

From comparing it with other works however, I've come to see it as maxing out the brain's potential while the desire to keep maxing the brain's potential exists. Flow states can be reached without challenge in things like meditation.

## Flow Cycle (4 Stages of Flow)
- Struggle
- Release
- Flow
- Recovery


> In his book, The Rise of Superman, Steven Kotler examines the lives of extreme athletes and their pursuit of flow while drawing parallels to those of us with more mundane lives. Kotler enumerates 4 stages of flow, which help elucidate ways to better set up flow states in day-to-day coding: Struggle, Release, Flow, and Recovery.

Struggle
> Struggle is just that — the overwhelming part of the cycle, where the challenge is difficult and your brain is working hard to form new connections and make associations with an overload of information. It’s likely you aren’t making much progress at this point, and it’s frustrating. You may be diagramming possible solutions, reading through related parts of the code base, or talking with a co-worker to understand what it is you’re trying to implement. Struggle isn’t fun, but it’s a critical part of the flow cycle — giving your brain the information it needs to begin developing a solution.

Release
> During Release, you take your conscious mind off the problem. The could be activities like: going for a walk, playing ping pong, sitting in the park, meditating, or yoga. During this phase, your brain is organizing the problem subconsciously and forming connections between the pieces loaded during Struggle.

> This is a necessary part of tackling any larger problem. Our working memory can hold a very limited set of objects in it at any given time, so solving complex coding problems isn’t possible without the aid of our higher-capacity non-conscious brain.

> One interesting note: because of the way which they stimulate your brain, watching TV will not aid in this subconscious processing. It will actually block your ability to transition into the next stage in the cycle. (I suspect video games fall into this category as well, but Kotler doesn’t mention them specifically.)

Flow
> In this stage, you feel in the zone. Flow allows you to focus on the task at hand without distraction, often slipping into a state where time seems to pass differently and problem solving just happens. You are fully immersed in the task at hand.

Recovery
> Finally, once the Flow stage is complete, your brain and body need recovery. I believe this is the most frequently skipped portion of the flow state, making it difficult to restart the cycle. Because each of the prior stages requires the release of neurochemicals and a great deal of energy consumption, the body and mind need time to reset before you can enter into flow again effectively. Similar to neglecting rest and recovery after a hard workout, attempting to skip this final stage in the flow cycle will mean you get stuck in Struggle — leaving you unable to reap the benefits and move back into Flow.

- Clear and immediate feedback
- Good balance between one’s perceived skills and those perceived as necessary for the task
- Uninterrupted concentration time
