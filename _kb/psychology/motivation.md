## How to Create Motivation
- Extrinsic Motivation
- Intrinsic Motivation


## Notes
- doing nothing makes you more lethargic
- not having to do anything is a great habit break from constantly having to achieve
- my body feels best when I stress it so it has to wake up. Now I make sure to do something physically challenging even if for a few seconds.
- routine is better for state than just doing whatever. Doing whatever is great for recovery but not for an entire day.
