A desire to act

## How to Create Motivation
- Extrinsic Motivation
- Intrinsic Motivation


## Notes
- doing nothing makes you more lethargic
- not having to do anything is a great habit break from constantly having to achieve
- my body feels best when I stress it so it has to wake up. Now I make sure to do something physically challenging even if for a few seconds.
- routine is better for state than just doing whatever. Doing whatever is great for recovery but not for an entire day.

In other words, if I waited a day, nothing bad would happen. Turns out that I don’t get motivated by external factors. What helped me the most was opening my identity doc and internalizing the phrase “I want to be the kind of person who…” and finishing that in all the ways I want to embody. That changes the goal from _doing_ to _being_. That’s what worked best for me. And when I’m on a roll during the day, the rest is easy. That’s why I always start my day with a set routine and plan the night before. Does that resonate with you?

I had autonomy, mastery, and purpose for a lot of things I wanted to do, but no urgency to do them. In other words, if I waited a day, nothing bad would happen.

“I want to be the kind of person who…” and finishing that in all the ways I want to embody. That changes the goal from _doing_ to _being_.

Routines (action >> state)

- 2. Short-term and long-term happiness. This is strongly linked to the marsh-mallow experiment (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/what-the-marshmallow-test-really-teaches-about-self-control/380673/). We are more happy and successful in the long-term if we relinquish things that make us only happy in the short-term but don't fit to our overall mindset (watching series, YT, ...; or other forms of procrastinating) and focus on things that make us happy in the long-term.

4. Know Thyself: For me it was extremely useful to find out what motivates me intrinsically and extrinsically, what doesn't and most importantly what makes me experience joy. For instance, after a series of networking events my energy is just drained. If I'm only coaching, studying topics I like, working, training, etc. I could continue doing that without rest for a couple of weeks doing nothing else probably. But after networking events, a couple of important calls for Kairos with investors, etc. or just studying boring stuff my energy gets drained quicker. I still don't know if I could overcome this by just training my willpower more and more, but usually I reserve some free time after those events in order to meet friends, hike up a beautiful mountain, run and mediate to recover. These are forms of short-term happiness I never regret, so they restore a lot of energy and then I'm ready to go again. I believe that everybody has different things that are subjectively more or less energy draining or restoring. That's why I think it's highly important to be aware of those things by tracking them and finally establishing one's own energy budget that works long-term.

5. Using psychological triggers. Research suggest that certain locations trigger different emotions and different habits. Obviously, I find it harder to work with my lap-top in the bed than doing the same in the library. So I use these triggers in order to stay motivated and initiate certain routines. Most importantly, I never mix the locations. So I do not answer mails when I'm in the library, I do not study at home on my desk (I use it only for work, calls and mails) and so on. This is pretty basic and obvious, but still very powerful.

6. Nutrition: Research suggests that we are more productive and cognitively stimulated when in a calorie deficit.

7. Daily Meditation

- People are motivated by quality of life increase, not maintenance.
