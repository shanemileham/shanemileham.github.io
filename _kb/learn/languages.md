Some Notes On Learning Languages from Jason, Co-Founder of Podstel - Polygot, 9 Languages Fluently.
- Remember: 3000 words = 80% of occurrences, 500 most common words = 60%  understanding of language.
- Images - connect every word you are trying to learn to a mental image, NOT the English translation. Associate it with the image of the word.
- Speaking to people - just repeat their questions. Say things wrong if you don't know the German. Add the English in as well.
- Putting words together - start mixing words and creating sample sentences even if they sound stupid.
- Modelling - imitate people's speech, their gestures, watch how they use their face.
- Hacks - learn the new noun with it's gender, learn plural at the same time, only read things and do things that you are going to do on an everyday basis in that language.
- Mnemonics - create funny stories to remember words. Also abbreviations work too.
- Image Search - Google Image search for dictionary.
- Role playing activities with a friend - Great way to immerse. Practicing by teaching someone what you have been taught is a great way to internalise new information.
- Music - Listen to music from the language you are trying to learn on Spotify.
- Flash Cards - physical cards preferably with images. Have a system for the cards you don't know. Don't try to remember the English, think of the concept and visualise it to make it stick. Broken down by daily, weekly, monthly review - don't write down single words, write down phrases. Learn sentence in context. Colour coded.
- Translation - remember to translate from English to New Language, not the other way around.
- Talk out everything - phone numbers, shopping items, signs, simulate conversations in your head
- Writing/Code switching - When practicing writing, write as much as you can in the New Language without a translator and then fill in the gaps with English. Just write; don't worry about it being right.
- Create audio files - record yourself speaking out sentences, paragraphs, then listen to them on walks/runs.
- Thinking in new language - consciously alter your thought process so thatyou begin to think in the new language.
- Dual language books - or get a book you know in English.
- Notepad - carry a pocket notepad, dictionary and grammar book with you at all time. Write down words you don't know when you are out and about.
- Memorising new words - Repeating the same sentence is less use than making subtle changes to the patterns you are learning. So change the pronoun, the noun or some other aspect of the sentence. Make sure the sentences you are speaking reflect your own reality as well.
