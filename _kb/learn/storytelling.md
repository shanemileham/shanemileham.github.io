## Storytelling Overview


- What is a story?
- Why are you telling a story? To whom? What do they want?
- What makes a story interesting/memorable?
- What questions can you ask to make someone else's story memorable?

“Think of a moment in which your own failures led to success in your career, or a lesson that a parent or mentor imparted,” says Sachs. “Any of these things can be interesting emotional entry points to a story.”

Why tell a story? deepens who we are as human beings. gives our lives purpose. connection to others.

Tips

- Give character a spine (decision making core) (wall-e: find the beauty; marlin: prevent harm to nemo; ...)
- The audience wants to work for their meal (2+2).
- Stories aren't exact or predictable
- All well drawn characters have a dominant unconscious goal. Acknowledge what drives you take the wheel and steer it

## Important Storytelling Frameworks

### The Hero's Journey (Monomyth)
_"A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man" -Joseph Campbell_

"Heroism, after all, is contagious."

High Level
1. Departure - receives a call to adventure, is reluctant, but is helped by a mentor
2. Initiation - traverses the threshold into the unknown, faces trials, overcomes the main obstacles/enemy, gains reward
3. Return - traverses back to the ordinary world with treasure for benefit of fellow man (hero is transformed by adventure and has power over both worlds)

In Depth (Campbell)
- Departure
  1. Call to adventure - the hero, living in normality, receives information to head off into the unknown
  2. Refusal of the call - often the hero initially refuses the call (possibly from duty, fear, insecurity, ...)
  3. Meeting the Mentor (Supernatural aid) - guide appears (often supernatural) and frequently gives hero artifacts for his/her quest
  4. Crossing the threshold - hero leaves own world and ventures into dangerous realm with unknown rules and limits
  5. Belly of the whale - the final separation from the hero's known world and self, showing a willingness to undergo metamorphosis (and initially encountering a minor danger) ("The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died.")
- Initiation
  6. The road of trials - a series of tests for the hero to overcome (usually in sets of 3; hero often fails one or more tests)
  7. The meeting with the goddess
  8. Woman as temptress
  9. Atonement with the father
  10. Apotheosis
  11. The ultimate boon
- Return
  12. Refusal of the return
  13. The magic flight
  14. Rescue from without
  15. The crossing of the return threshold
  16. Master of two worlds
  17. Freedom to live

### The Pitch
(See my pitch deck post for more details)

- The Shift
  - Start with a big, undeniable change that creates stakes. No matter what you’re selling, your most formidable obstacle is prospects’ adherence to the status quo. Your primary adversary, in other words, is a voice inside people’s heads that goes, We’ve gotten along just fine without it, and we’ll always be fine without it.
  - Demonstrate the world has changed in a fundamental way that (1) is undeniable, (2) is happening independently of your company, and (3) gives rise to stakes
- The Enemy
  - Name the enemy. What is stopping the aspiring heroes (marketers? salespeople? your target audience) from reaching their goal?
  - Naming a common enemy will put you and the investors on the same side psychologically
  - (Prove pain exists, Show who has the pain, Use a relatable story)
- The Promised Land
  - Show the future that is possible thanks to having your product
  - This should be both (a) desirable (obviously) and (b) difficult for prospects to reach without you
- The Magic Wand
  - Imagine if... (instead of having to do X, you could do Y)
  - Introduce your product and its unique value proposition through the lens of the benefit to the hero (new capability, easier behavior, etc.)
  - Use pictures to show this benefit
- Proof that the Magic Wand will get people to the Promised Land
  - Testimonials, stats
