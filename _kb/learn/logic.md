## Steps
- [Coursera - Introduction to Logic](https://www.coursera.org/learn/logic-introduction) (at least the first 6-7 lessons)
- [Read and understand Set Theory](https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/math-sets.html)
- [Learn and understand MECE](https://www.preplounge.com/en/bootcamp.php/case-cracking-toolbox/structure-your-thoughts/mece-principle)
- [Bonus - Learn Bayes' Rule!](https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq)

If you get through the links above, I will give you formal logic exercises related to language and communication. These are a gold mine of learning - honestly the most valuable thing I ever did in college.
