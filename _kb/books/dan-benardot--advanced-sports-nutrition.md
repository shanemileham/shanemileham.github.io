## Part I: Nutrition Sources for Athletes
### Chapter 1 - Energy Nutrients
- Physical activity increases rate of energy expenditure
- Athletes have a greater need for energy nutrients than do nonathletes
- The higher the exercise intensity, the greater the proportionate reliance on carbohydrates as a fuel
- Calorie = amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1g water by 1 degree C (in nutrition a "calorie" is really a kilocalorie or kcal)

#### Carbohydrate
- Glucose is the main fuel for the creation of muscular energy (ATP)
- Failure to sustain glucose delivery to working muscles results in cessation of high-intensity activity ("hitting the wall")
- Avoid glucose depletion
- Humans have limited storage capacity for carbohydrate (unlike protein and fat)
- Blood sugar (blood glucose) is the primary fuel for the brain
- Low blood sugar --> mental fatigue
- Mental fatigue --> muscular fatigue (regardless of how much energy is stored in muscles)
- Liver glycogen + blood glucose --> 18min of exercise
