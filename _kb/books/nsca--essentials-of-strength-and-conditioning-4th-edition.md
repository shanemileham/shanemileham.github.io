## Chapter 1 - Structure and Function of Body Systems

### Musculoskeletal System

![Appendicular vs Axial Skeleton](http://www.teachpe.com/images/anatomy-physiology/axiel-skeleton400.jpg)

Skeleton
- Heavy loads/impact --> bone density ++, mineral content ++
- Adaptation period of bone is longer than skeletal muscle
- Vary stimulus frequency, intensity, type

![Types of Joints](http://slideplayer.com/9732189/31/images/3/Types+of+Joints+Fibrous+joint+Cartilaginous+joint+Synovial+joint.jpg)
- Fibrous joints allow virtually no movement
- Cartilaginous joints allow limited movement
- Synovial joints allow considerable movement

![Structure of Skeletal Muscle](http://library.open.oregonstate.edu/aandp/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/1001_Muscle_Tissue_revised-1024x516.png)
- Epimysium = fibrous connective tissue contiguous with tendons
- Tendon is attached to bone periosteum
- Bone periosteum = connective tissue covering all bones
- Muscle cells (fibers) = long cylindricals cells 50-100um in diameter, containing many nuclei
- Fasciculi = muscle fiber bundles consisting of up to 150 fibers

![Neiromuscular Junction](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DxShix3Mqow/hqdefault.jpg)
- Each muscle cell has only one neuromuscular junction (although a single motor neuron innervates many muscle fibers)

![Motor Unit](http://images.tutorvista.com/content/nervous-coordination/neuron-structure.jpeg)
- Motor Unit = a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates

![Muscle Fiber](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Walter_Frontera/publication/266680796/figure/fig2/AS:392133790978056@1470503390011/The-transverse-tubules-and-sarcoplasmic-reticulum-systems-Adapted-by-permission-from.png)
- Myofibrils contain myofilaments (of types [myosin, actin])
- Myofibrils diameter = ~1um
- Myosin diameter = ~15nm
- Actin diameter = ~6nm
- Sarcomere = smallest contractile unit of skeletal muscle
  - Diameter = ~2.5um

![Sliding-Filament Theory]()

![Sliding-Filament Theory Phases]()
- Resting phase
  - Little calcium present (most stored in sarcoplasmic reticulum)
- Excitation-Contraction Coupling Phase
  - Release of calcium ions
  - Calcium binds with troponin
  - Causes shift in tropomyosin
  - Exposes the actin-tropomyosin(?) binding site
  - Note: muscular force =k* bound crossbridges
- Contraction Phase (Power Stroke)
  - The enzyme myosin adenosine Triphosphatase (myosin ATPase) causes hydrolysis (breakdown) of ATP into ADP+P
  - This hydrolysis changes the conformation of the myosin head (already bound to the actin), pulling the actin
  - ATP replaces ADP on the myosin crossbridge globular head, allowing the head to detach from the active actin site and return to its original position
  - If calcium is available, contraction can continue; else, relaxation occurs
  - Note: calcium is used for a lot of other things like glycolytic and oxidative energy metabolism, protein synthesis and degredation
- Recharge Phase
  - Repeated actions above, conditional on sufficient myosin ATPase, ATP, calcium
- Relaxation Phase
  - Upon stimulation of the motor nerve
  - Calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  - Insufficient calcium in the sarcoplasm prevents contraction
  - ATP finishes actin-myosin decoupling

### Neuromuscular System

Notes
- Motor neuron innervates many muscle fibers
- All or None principle - When a motor neuron fires, all the fibers it innervates are activated at once
- Fewer muscle fibers per neuron --> greater precision (e.g. eyes have 1:1)

Process
- Motor neuron sends action potential to nerve terminal
- Releases neurotransmitter acetlycholine (ACH)
- ACH diffuses across neuromuscular junction
- Action potential is generated along the sarcolemma
