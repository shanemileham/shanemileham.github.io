## Notes

### Chapter 1: Planning, calculating, and comparing armies leads to war
- Compare armies
  - Obedience (to the death)
  - More capable general
  - Weather/Terrain
  - Discipline enforcement
  - Stronger army
  - Better trained
  - Consistency in rewards/punishments for discipline
- Make meticulous plans

### Chapter 2: Secure yourself against defeat, and wait for an opportunity for victory
Five rules for victory
1. You must know when to fight and when not to fight
2. You must know how to deal with forces both inferior and superior to your own
3. Your army must have a strong, uniform fighting spirit and discipline throughout its ranks
4. You must fight so that you are prepared and the enemy is unprepared
5. You must have the military capacity and freedom to command your tropps without interference from a sovereign

Do
- Only enter battles you know you will win
- Be cautious
- Attack only when you have the advantage
- Attack where your enemy is weak

Avoid
- Your enemy where he is strong
- Your enemy's army when it has spirit, discipline, and a more advantagous position
- Entering battle in anger
- Traps from your enemy
- Leading your army into places where your supplies cannot reach you or you do not know the terrain or your allies well

### Chapter 3: Warfare is only successful if sovereigns and generals do not cause their own defeat
Generals are commanded by sovereigns. A mistake by either can cause defeat.

Sovereign Mistakes
- Commanding an army to advance or retreat when impossible
- Attempting to govern the army as laxly as he does his state
- Placing officers in inappropriate roles

General Mistakes
- Recklessly lead army to destruction
- Be a coward and be captured
- Have hubris and be provoked by the enemy
- Too concerned with the comfort of his own men

General is also responsible if
1. Defeat - Fights army 10x size causing soldiers to flee
2. Insubordination - Soldiers are too strong in relation to the officers
3. Weakness - Soldiers are too weak
4. Irrationality - Higher officers are undisciplined
5. Indecisive - General is weak and indecisive
6. Unknown - Unable to estimate an enemy's strength and hurls an inferior force against a superior one

### Chapter 4: Conserve your resources through strategems, foraging, and espionage
- Maintaining an army is expensive
- Aim for quick and decisive victories
- Avoid besieging walled cities (prep, impatient generals, ...)
- Capture enemy (country/city/army) with much larger force
- Subdue enemies without fighting - Win with ease
- Take resources from enemy (weapons, armor, men)
- Use spies to get info and give false info
- Maintain intimate relations with spies adn reward them well (high ROI)
- If you build a strategem around a secret from a spy, kill spy and other people so strategem maintains power

### Chapter 5: Deceive your enemy and impose your will on him
Deceive
- Mask strength with weakness
- Mask courage with timidity
- Mask order with disorder
- Keep enemy guessing where you will attack

Impose will
- If he has a temper, irritate him
- If he is at ease, harass him
- If well supplied, starve him
- If quietly encamped, force him to move
- If you wish the enemy to advance, hold out bait to him
- If you wish him to retreat, inflict damage on him
- Force enemy to reveal himself so you can see vulnerabilities
- Make enemy defend many fronts
- Attack weak points to make him rush to defend

### Chapter 6: Observe the terrain and your enemy, then adapt accordingly
Observe terrain
- Do not climb heights, go upstream, or travel away from water and shelter
- Avoid cliffs or confined spaces where a small force can destroy an army
- Look for startled birds or beasts; they indicate you are approaching an ambush

Observe enemy
- Lean on spears → faint from starvation
- Water gatherers drink first → suffing from thirst
- Eat own cattle, neglect to hang pots, act as if they won't return to tents → willing to fight to the death
